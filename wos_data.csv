K-means clustering was performed on the MS peak data to obtain the best ""feature peaks"", and four different machine learning models were built to compare the area under the ROC curve, specificity, sensitivity, test set score, and ten-fold cross-validation score of the models. By adjusting the model parameters, the test efficacy of the model is increased on the basis of reducing model overfitting. The area under the ROC curve of the Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Xgboost models used in this study are 0.99, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively; the model scores on the test set are 0.94, 0.91, 0.90, and 0.93, respectively; and the results of the ten-fold cross-validation are 0.84, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.85, respectively.

However, this type of data is difficult to analyze due to its complexity, and sometimes it is impossible to make a correct labeling. To address this problem, advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning (ML) methods can be applied. This research proposes a methodology to classify mass spectrometry (MS) data applying a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach called self-training. This type of learning uses labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously in the training process to alleviate the scarcity of data labels. To demonstrate the efficiency of this proposal, MS data of healthy salmon infected with the pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis was analyzed. Experimental results showed that self-training with random forest performs appropriately, achieving an accuracy of 0.9.

Despite these species being commercially crucial, their taxonomy is still based on inaccurate identification methods. In this study, we present a novel approach for identifying two important Weissella species, W. cibaria and W. confusa, by combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) data using machine-learning techniques. After on- and off-plate protein extraction, we observed that the BioTyper database misidentified or could not differentiate Weissella species. Although Weissella species exhibited very similar protein profiles, these species can be differentiated on the basis of the results of a statistical analysis. To classify W. cibaria, W. confusa, and non-target Weissella species, machine learning was used for 167 spectra, which led to the listing of potential species-specific mass-to-charge (m/z) loci. Machine-learning techniques including artificial neural networks, principal component analysis combined with the K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest were used. The model that applied the Radial Basis Function kernel algorithm in SVM achieved classification accuracy of 1.0 for training and test sets.

This study aimed to explore the potential of MALDI-TOF MS protein profiles, coupled with prediction methods, to differentiate between Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis) and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (B. longum). The investigation involved the analysis of mass spectra of 59 B. longum strains and 41 B. infantis strains, leading to the identification of five distinct biomarker peaks, specifically at m/z 2,929, 4,408, 5,381, 5,394, and 8,817, using Recurrent Feature Elimination (RFE). To facilate classification between B. longum and B. infantis based on the mass spectra, machine learning models were developed, employing algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM).

In addition, our study considers the use of labeled and unlabeled data to alleviate the issue of data labeling. Specifically, mass spectrometry data of healthy and infected salmon with the Piscirickettsia salmonis pathogen was analyzed. Our proposed algorithm based on self-training showed superior performance compared to traditional ML methods (NB, RF, SVM). Even considering a small percentage of labeled instances (25%), semi-supervised learning attains equilibrated performance across all metrics. Experimental results showed that self-training with a random forest classifier reached an accuracy of 0.9, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 1.

There are many similarities between L. monocytogenes and other nonp-athogenic Listeria species, which causes great difficulties for their correct identification. The level of L. monocytogenes contamination in food remains high according to statistics from the Food and Drug Administration. This situation leads to food recall and destruction, which has caused huge economic losses to the food industry. Therefore, the identification of Listeria species is very important for clinical treatment and food safety. This work aims to explore an efficient classification algorithm which could easily and reliably distinguish Listeria species. We attempted to classify Listeria species by incorporating denoising autoencoder (DAE) and machine learning algorithms in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In addition, convolutional neural networks were used to map the high dimensional original mass spectrometry data to low dimensional core features. By analyzing MALDI-TOF MS data via incorporating DAE and support vector machine (SVM), the identification accuracy of Listeria species was 100%. The proposed classification algorithm is fast (range of seconds), easy to handle, and, more importantly, this method also allows for extending the identification scope of bacteria. The DAE model used in our research is an effective tool for the extraction of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry features. Despite the fact that the MALDI-TOF MS dataset examined in our research had high dimensionality, the DAE + SVM algorithm was still able to exploit the hidden information embedded in the original MALDI-TOF mass spectra. The experimental results in our work demonstrated that MALDI-TOF mass spectrum combined with DAE + SVM could easily and reliably distinguish Listeria species.",English,,Article,"Listeria species; MALDI-TOF; Denoising autoencoder; Machine learning;

Affected animals will experience production losses, and in uncurable cases, operations will need to be modified or animals culled. Producers and veterinary personnel have consistent interest in new diagnostic tools to provide rapid, accurate, and simple testing strategies which do not undermine financial viability of the operation. This manuscript describes a new approach for diagnosis of mastitis in dairy animals. The new method involves first analyzing raw milk from animals by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and collecting mass spectra. Then, peaks from the mass spectra are imported into a machine learning model, and this software application discovers non-obvious patterns present in the data which coincide with the mastitis condition. Finally, a separate set of milk samples is analyzed (scoring set) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the new model. Results suggest that certain machine learning models offer value to the producer for diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. More generally, the manuscript outlines use of the machine learning approach for diagnoses of animal disease, and we prophesize that this strategy may be applicable to a wide array of animal health concerns. Novel strategies for diagnostic screening of animal and herd health are crucial to contain disease outbreaks, maintain animal health, and maximize production efficiency. Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland in dairy cows, often resulting from infection from a microorganism. Mastitis outbreaks result in loss of production, degradation of milk quality, and the need to isolate and treat affected animals. In this work, we evaluate MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as a diagnostic for the culture-less screening of mastitis state from raw milk samples collected from regional dairies. Since sample preparation requires only minutes per sample using microvolumes of reagents and no cell culture, the technique is promising for rapid sample turnaround and low-cost diagnosis. Machine learning algorithms have been used to detect patterns embedded within MALDI-TOF spectra using a training set of 226 raw milk samples. A separate scoring set of 100 raw milk samples has been used to assess the specificity (spc) and sensitivity (sens) of the approach. Of machine learning models tested, the gradient-boosted tree model gave global optimal results, with the Youden index of J = 0.7, sens = 0.89, and spc = 0.81 achieved for the given set of conditions. Random forest models also performed well, achieving J > 0.63, with sens = 0.83 and spc = 0.81. Naive Bayes, generalized linear, fast large-margin, and deep learning models failed to produce diagnostic results that were as favorable. We conclude that MALDI-TOF MS combined with machine learning is an alternative diagnostic tool for detection of high somatic cell count (SCC) and subclinical mastitis in dairy herds.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"diagnosis; mastitis; MALDI-TOF; somatic cell count; intramammary

Dis-tinguishing thermal treated milk samples under different conditions has the practical significance for the authentication and quality control of milk products. In this study, a simple and accurate method for the discrimination of thermal processed milk samples based on matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and machine learning was established. Milk samples collected from local dairy farms were incubated with varying temperature and heating duration to cover a wide range of heat load. MS signals of featured peptides were selected by three orthogonal statistical methods, including partial least-squares -discriminant (PLS-DA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and recursive feature elimina-tion with cross-validation (RFECV). The featured peptides were used as training and testing variables for machine learning. A total of 14 algorithms were implemented and evaluated to construct machine learning model to discriminate thermal treated milk samples. Finally, the model was evaluated and compared by accuracy, recall, F1 value and accuracy, and the optimal model was selected.

Here, we assessed the utility of MALDI-TOF MS in differentiating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vs non-COVID acute respiratory infections (NCARIs) in a clinical lab setting in Kazakhstan. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from inpatients and outpatients with respiratory symptoms and from asymptomatic controls (ACs) in 2020-2022. PCR was used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2+ and NCARI cases. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were obtained for a total of 252 samples (115 SARS-CoV-2+, 98 NCARIs, and 39 ACs) without specialized sample preparation. In our first sub-analysis, we followed a published protocol for peak preprocessing and machine learning (ML), trained on publicly available spectra from South American SARS-CoV-2+ and NCARI samples. In our second sub-analysis, we trained ML models on a peak intensity matrix representative of both South American (SA) and Kazakhstan (Kaz) samples. Applying the established MALDI-TOF MS pipeline ""as is"" resulted in a high detection rate for SARS-CoV-2+ samples (91.0%), but low accuracy for NCARIs (48.0%) and ACs (67.0%) by the top-performing random forest model. After re-training of the ML algorithms on the SA-Kaz peak intensity matrix, the accuracy of detection by the top-performing support vector machine with radial basis function kernel model was at 88.0%, 95.0%, and 78% for the Kazakhstan SARS-CoV-2+, NCARI, and AC subjects, respectively, with a SARS-CoV-2 vs rest receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.983 [0.958, 0.987]; a high differentiation accuracy was maintained for the South American SARS-CoV-2 and NCARIs. MALDI-TOF MS/ML is a feasible approach for the differentiation of ARI without specialized sample preparation. The implementation of MALDI-TOF MS/ML in a real clinical lab setting will necessitate continuous optimization to keep up with the rapidly evolving landscape of ARI.IMPORTANCEIn this proof-of-concept study, the authors used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and machine learning (ML) to identify and distinguish acute respiratory infections (ARI) caused by SARS-CoV-2 versus other pathogens in low-resource clinical settings, without the need for specialized sample preparation.

Due to their different antibiotic susceptibility pattern, a rapid and accurate identification method is necessary for their differentiation. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has proven useful for NTM identification, the differentiation of M. abscessus subspecies is challenging. In this study, a collection of 325 clinical isolates of M. abscessus was used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis and for the development of machine learning predictive models based on MALDI-TOF MS protein spectra. Overall, using a random forest model with several confidence criteria (samples by triplicate and similarity values >60%), a total of 96.5% of isolates were correctly identified at the subspecies level. Moreover, an improved model with Spanish isolates was able to identify 88.9% of strains collected in other countries. In addition, differences in culture media, colony morphology, and geographic origin of the strains were evaluated, showing that the latter had an impact on the protein spectra. Finally, after studying all protein peaks previously reported for this species, two novel peaks with potential for subspecies differentiation were found.

Random forest models built with the data preprocessed by the ensemble method outperformed individual preprocessing methods and achieved the highest accuracy, with values of 84.37% (A. baumannii), 90.96% (A. nosocomialis), 78.54% (E. faecium), and 70.12% (GBS) on independent testing datasets. Through feature selection, important peaks related to antibiotic resistance could be detected from integrated information. The prediction model can provide an opinion for clinicians. The discriminative peaks enabling better prediction performance can provide a reference for further investigation of the resistance mechanism.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,MALDI-TOF MS; machine learning; antibiotic resistance

Isolation and identification of Actinomyces by conventional methods is often difficult and time consuming. In recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has become a rapid and simple method to identify bacteria. Objective: The present study evaluated a new in-house algorithm using MALDI-TOF-MS for rapid identification of different species of oral Actinomyces cultivated from subgingival biofilm. Design: Eleven reference strains and 674 clinical strains were used in this study. All the strains were preliminarily identified using biochemical methods and then subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis using both similarity-based analysis and classification methods (support vector machine [SVM]). The genotype of the reference strains and of 232 clinical strains was identified by sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Results: The sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of all references strains confirmed their previous identification. The MALDI-TOF-MS spectra obtained from the reference strains and the other clinical strains undoubtedly identified as Actinomyces by 16S rRNA sequencing were used to create the mass spectra reference database. Already a visual inspection of the mass spectra of different species reveals both similarities and differences. However, the differences between them are not large enough to allow a reliable differentiation by similarity analysis. Therefore, classification methods were applied as an alternative approach for differentiation and identification of Actinomyces at the species level. A cross-validation of the reference database representing 14 Actinomyces species yielded correct results for all species which were represented by more than two strains in the database. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a combination of MALDI-TOF-MS with powerful classification algorithms, such as SVMs, provide a useful tool for the differentiation and identification of oral Actinomyces.",English,Green Published,Article,MALDI-TOF-MS; oral Actinomyces; support vector machine

The presence and absence of specific peaks on MS spectra are commonly used to identify the bacterial species and predict antibiotic-resistant strains. However, the conventional approach using few single peaks would result in insufficient prediction power without using complete information of whole MS spectra. In the past few years, machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to analyze the MALDI-TOF MS peaks pattern for rapid strain typing. In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) method to deal with the complete information of MALDI-TOF MS spectra for detecting Enterococcus faecium, which is one of the leading pathogens in the world. We developed a CNN model to rapidly and accurately predict vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) samples from the whole mass spectra profiles of clinical samples. The CNN models demonstrated good classification performances with the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.887 when using external validation data independently. Additionally, we employed the score-class activation mapping (CAM) method to identify the important features of our CNN models and found some discriminative signals that can substantially contribute to detecting the ion of resistance.

Current tools based on DNA sequencing or microsatellite analysis require specific manipulations that are difficult to implement in the context of routine diagnosis. Using deep learning to classify the mass spectra obtained during the routine identification of fungi by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry could be of interest to differentiate isolates belonging to epidemic clones from others. As part of the management of a nosocomial outbreak due to Candida parapsilosis in two Parisian hospitals, we studied the impact of the preparation of the spectra on the performance of a deep neural network. Our purpose was to differentiate 39 otherwise fluconazole-resistant isolates belonging to a clonal subset from 56 other isolates, most of which were fluconazole-susceptible, collected during the same period and not belonging to the clonal subset. Our study carried out on spectra obtained on four different machines from isolates cultured for 24 or 48 h on three different culture media showed that each of these parameters had a significant impact on the performance of the classifier. In particular, using different culture times between learning and testing steps could lead to a collapse in the accuracy of the predictions. On the other hand, including spectra obtained after 24 and 48 h of growth during the learning step restored the good results. Finally, we showed that the deleterious effect of the device variability used for learning and testing could be largely improved by including a spectra alignment step during preprocessing before submitting them to the neural network. Taken together, these experiments show the great potential of deep learning models to identify spectra of specific clones, providing that crucial parameters are controlled during both culture and preparation steps before submitting spectra to a classifier.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"MALDI TOF; epidemiology; Candida parapsilosis; neural network;

Recently, machine learning techniques have been leveraged to maximally exploit the information contained in MALDI-TOF MS, with the ultimate goal to refine species identification and streamline antimicrobial resistance determination. Objectives: The aim was to systematically review and evaluate studies employing machine learning for the analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Data sources: Using PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science, we searched the existing literature for machine learning-supported applications of MALDI-TOF mass spectra for microbial species and antimicrobial susceptibility identification. Study eligibility criteria: Original research studies using machine learning to exploit MALDI-TOF mass spectra for microbial specie and antimicrobial susceptibility identification were included. Studies focusing on single proteins and peptides, case studies and review articles were excluded. Methods: A systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed and a quality assessment of the machine learning models conducted. Results: From the 36 studies that met our inclusion criteria, 27 employed machine learning for species identification and nine for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Support Vector Machines, Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks and Quick Classifiers were the most frequently used machine learning algorithms. The quality of the studies ranged between poor and very good. The majority of the studies reported how to interpret the predictors (88.89%) and suggested possible clinical applications of the developed algorithm (100%), but only four studies (11.11%) validated machine learning algorithms on external datasets. Conclusions: A growing number of studies utilize machine learning to optimize the analysis of MALDITOF mass spectra.

Ecological studies require accurate identification of specimens. This is very time consuming when processing plankton, meiobenthos or soil biota samples due to the presence of a high number of minute specimens. A solution to this problem may be MALDI-TOF MS, an emerging technique for identification of metazoan species. As an alternative to factory delivered software or clustering approaches, Random Forest (RF) models can be trained to identify species, using MALDI-TOF data. However, in a real-world scenario, RF models will fail in detecting species which were not included in the training dataset as well, thus producing false positives (misidentifications). 2. We produced MALDI-TOF MS spectra for meiofauna species and trained RF models, using MALDI-TOF bins as predictors and species as multi-level target class. We used the empirical beta distribution of the probability of class assignment in the model to design a post hoc test for false positive discovery. Two strategies increase the final accuracy of species identification: (1) ""class smoothing"" consisting of in silico observations of classes, created by bootstrapping the value of each predictor within each class and: (2) adding a ""null class"" to the training dataset by bootstrapping predictor values and shuffling predictor labels creating a class without multivariate signal. 3. We prove that RF is an excellent method for species identification, using MALDI-TOF MS data. The models are flexible enough to correctly classify observations created in silico by smoothing the classes. Our post hoc test unmasks false positive classifications successfully. Smoothing the classes and adding a null class to the training model attracts assignment of false positives to this class. In our example, a 100% false positive discovery could be achieved, while maintaining very high overall prediction accuracy. 4. Combining MALDI-TOF MS and RF models is a step towards a fully automatic species identification workflow that is particularly necessary for species-rich communities of small organism for ecological studies but also for routine monitoring. The post hoc test for false positive discovery can be applied to any RF multilevel classification model, not only in a biological context.",English,Bronze,Article,"false positive; machine learning tools; MALDI-TOF MS; Meiobenthos;

The conventional method of serotyping, known as the Quellung reaction, is both time-consuming and expensive. However, the emergence of MALDI-TOF MS technology has revolutionized microbiology laboratories by enabling rapid and cost-effective serotyping based on protein profiles.Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate the viability of utilizing MALDI-TOF MS technology as an adjunctive and screening method for capsular typing of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our approach involved developing classification models based on MALDI-TOF MS to discern between Streptococcus pneumoniae strains originating from PCV13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and NON PCV13 isolates.Methods: Firstly, we established a comprehensive spectral database comprising isolates of serotypes present in the PCV13 vaccine, along with the top 10 most prevalent NON PCV13 serotypes based on local epidemiological data. This database served as a foundation for developing unsupervised models utilizing MALDI-TOF MS spectra, which enabled us to identify inherent patterns and relationships within the data.

Our approach involved developing classification models based on MALDI-TOF MS to discern between Streptococcus pneumoniae strains originating from PCV13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and NON PCV13 isolates.Results: Although our findings revealed suboptimal performance in serotype classification, they provide valuable insights into the potential of machine learning algorithms in this context. The sensitivity of the models ranged from 0.41 to 0.46, indicating their ability to detect certain serotypes. The observed specificity consistently remained at 0.60, suggesting a moderate level of accuracy in identifying non-vaccine serotypes. These results highlight the need for further refinement and optimization of the algorithms to enhance their discriminative power and predictive accuracy in serotype identification.By addressing the limitations identified in this study, such as exploring alternative feature selection techniques or optimizing algorithm parameters, we can unlock the full potential of machine learning in robust and reliable serotype classification of S. pneumoniae.

The existing nucleic acid test and antigen test suffer from long assay time and low sensitivity, respectively. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based nasal swabs analysis have been demonstrated as a promising technique in SARS-CoV-2 infection screening. However, the applicability of the technique in the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Given the prevalence of the Omicron variant since 2022, we developed a MALDI-TOF-based diagnosis method with nasal swab samples to detect the infection by this variant. We collected 325 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 221 SARS-CoV-2-negative nasal swab samples, and the molecular mass fingerprints were acquired from the samples by MALDI-TOF MS. Using a random forest machine learning classification model to analyze the molecular mass fingerprints MALDI-TOF mass spectra, the accuracy of 97%, false negative rate of 0%, and false positive rate of 7.6% were achieved for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Combining the MALDI-TOF analysis with top-down proteomics, we identified four potential protein biomarkers, that is, humanin-like 4, thymosin beta-10, thymosin beta-4 and statherin, in the nasal swab for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. It was further found that the four protein biomarkers can also differentiate the SARS-CoV-2 original strains infection and Omicron strains infection. These results suggest that the MALDI-TOF MS-based nasal swab analysis holds effective diagnostic capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shows promising potential for global application and extension to other infectious diseases.

GBS serotyping is an essential means for the investigation of possible infection outbreaks and can identify possible sources of infection. Although it is possible to determine GBS serotypes by either immuno-serotyping or geno-serotyping, both traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been reported as an effective tool for the determination of GBS serotypes in a more rapid and accurate manner. Thus, this work aims to investigate GBS serotypes by incorporating machine learning techniques with MALDI-TOF MS to carry out the identification. Results: In this study, a total of 787 GBS isolates, obtained from three research and teaching hospitals, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and the serotype of the GBS was determined by a geno-serotyping experiment. The peaks of mass-to-charge ratios were regarded as the attributes to characterize the various serotypes of GBS. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were then used to construct predictive models for the five different serotypes (Types Ia, Ib, III, V, and VI). After optimization of feature selection and model generation based on training datasets, the accuracies of the selected models attained 54.9-87.1% for various serotypes based on independent testing data. Specifically, for the major serotypes, namely type III and type VI, the accuracies were 73.9 and 70.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed models have been adopted to implement a web-based tool (GBSTyper), which is now freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/GBSTyper/, for providing efficient and effective detection of GBS serotypes based on a MALDI-TOF MS spectrum.

Resistance to the extensively used quinolone antibiotic, such as ciprofloxacin, has increased in Klebsiella pneumoniae, which leads to the increase in the risk of initial antibiotic selection for Klebsiella pneumoniae treatment. Rapid and precise identification of ciprofloxacin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CIRKP) is essential for clinical therapy. Nowadays, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is another approach to discover antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to its shorter inspection time and lower cost than other current methods. Machine learning methods are introduced to assist in discovering significant biomarkers from MALDI-TOF MS data and construct prediction models for rapid antibiotic resistance identification. This study examined 16,997 samples taken from June 2013 to February 2018 as part of a longitudinal investigation done by Change Gung Memorial Hospitals (CGMH) at the Linkou branch. We applied traditional statistical approaches to identify significant biomarkers, and then a comparison was made between high-importance features in machine learning models and statistically selected features. Large-scale data guaranteed the statistical power of selected biomarkers. Besides, clustering analysis analyzed suspicious sub-strains to provide potential information about their influences on antibiotic resistance identification performance. For modeling, to simulate the real antibiotic resistance predicting challenges, we included basic information about patients and the types of specimen carriers into the model construction process and separated the training and testing sets by time. Final performance reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89 for support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) models. Also, logistic regression and random forest models both achieved AUC around 0.85. In conclusion, models provide sensitive forecasts of CIRKP, which may aid in early antibiotic selection against Klebsiella pneumoniae. The suspicious sub-strains could affect the model performance.

Peptide fragments can be analyzed with higher sensitivity (often > 10(2) fold) and resolution using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers, leading to improved pattern recognition by common machine learning algorithms. In turn, enhanced sensitivity and specificity for bacterial sorting and/or disease diagnosis may be obtained. To test this hypothesis, four exemplar case studies have been pursued in which samples are sorted into dichotomous groups by machine learning (ML) software based on MALDI-TOF spectra. Samples were analyzed in 'intact' mode in which the proteins present in the sample were not digested with protease prior to MALDI-TOF analysis and separately after the standard overnight tryptic digestion of the same samples. For each case, sensitivity (sens), specificity (spc), and the Youdin index (J) were used to assess the ML model performance. The proteolytic digestion of samples prior to MALDI-TOF analysis substantially enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of dichotomous sorting. Two exceptions were when substantial differences in chemical composition between the samples were present and, in such cases, both 'intact' and 'digested' protocols performed similarly. The results suggest proteolytic digestion prior to analysis can improve sorting in MALDI/ML-based workflows and may enable improved biomarker discovery.

Among the 29 true serotypes, serotype 2 is the most significant due to its high prevalence in diseased pigs and its association with human clinical cases. The co-existence of strong and weak virulent strains of SS2 (Streptococcus suis serotype 2) complicates the surveillance, coupled with the fact that traditional methods based on serologic tests or multiple PCR are laborious and time-consuming, posing challenges to the prevention and control of streptococcosis. Therefore, developing a new method to rapidly detect S. suis serotype 2 and virulent strains thereof is extremely essential. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed among 137 S. suis strains covering all the true serotypes to explore its potential for identifying SS2 strains with strong virulence. By comparing mass spectrometry data with those of bacterial phenotypic and genomic properties, our study reveals, for the first time, the strong correlations between mass spectra patterns and the phenotypes (of serotype and virulence). In addition, machine learning-based classifiers have more than 90% accuracy in making correct judgments. Overall, the promising potential of MALDI-TOF MS for virulent SS2 detection was proven, and the corresponding methods disclosed in this study will pave the way for high speed-specific causative agent identification among more extensive bacterial species. IMPORTANCE To the best of our knowledge, this study reveals a strong correlation between mass spectra pattern and virulence phenotype among S. suis for the first time. In order to make the findings applicable and to excavate the intrinsic information in the spectra, the classifiers based on the machine learning algorithms were established, and RF (Random Forest)-based models have achieved an accuracy of over 90%.

This study aims to develop predictive models based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiles and machine learning for species-level identification. A total of 219 ECC and 118 Klebsiella aerogenes clinical isolates from three hospitals were included. The capability of the proposed method to differentiate the most common ECC species (Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter kobei, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter roggenkampii, Enterobacter ludwigii, and Enterobacter bugandensis) and K. aerogenes was demonstrated by applying unsupervised hierarchical clustering with principal-component analysis (PCA) preprocessing. We observed a distinctive clustering of E. hormaechei and K. aerogenes and a clear trend for the rest of the ECC species to be differentiated over the development data set. Thus, we developed supervised, nonlinear predictive models (support vector machine with radial basis function and random forest). The external validation of these models with protein spectra from two participating hospitals yielded 100% correct species-level assignment for E. asburiae, E. kobei, and E. roggenkampii and between 91.2% and 98.0% for the remaining ECC species; with data analyzed in the three participating centers, the accuracy was close to 100%. Similar results were obtained with the Mass Spectrometric Identification (MSI) database developed recently () except in the case of E. hormaechei, which was more accurately identified with the random forest algorithm. In short, MALDI-TOF MS combined with machine learning was demonstrated to be a rapid and accurate method for the differentiation of ECC species.",English,Green Published,Article,"Enterobacter species; mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF MS; peak analysis;

Considering its high prevalence in low and middle-income countries, a cheap, accurate and high-throughput screening test of thalassaemia prior to a more expensive confirmatory diagnostic test is urgently needed. Methods In this study, we constructed a machine learning model based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry quantification of haemoglobin chains in blood, and for the first time, evaluated its diagnostic efficacy in 674 thalassaemia (including both asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic patients) and control samples collected in three hospitals. Parameters related to haemoglobin imbalance (alpha-globin, beta-globin, gamma-globin, alpha/beta and alpha-beta) were used for feature selection before classification model construction with 8 machine learning methods in cohort 1 and further model efficiency validation in cohort 2. Results The logistic regression model with 5 haemoglobin peak features achieved good classification performance in validation cohort 2 (AUC 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1, sensitivity 98.7%, specificity 95.5%). Furthermore, the logistic regression model with 6 haemoglobin peak features was also constructed to specifically identify beta-thalassaemia (AUC 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97, sensitivity 96.5%, specificity 87.8% in validation cohort 2). Conclusions For the first time, we constructed an inexpensive, accurate and high-throughput classification model based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry quantification of haemoglobin chains and demonstrated its great potential in rapid screening of thalassaemia in large populations.

Methods and Results MALDI-TOF MS was performed on 115 R. anatipestifer strains (serotype 1, serotype 2, and other serotypes) to explore its ability to identify serotypes of R. anatipestifer. Raw spectral data were generated in diagnostic mode; these data were preprocessed, clustered, and analysed using principal component analysis. The results indicated that MALDI-TOF MS completely differentiated serotype 1 from serotype 2 of R. anatipestifer; the potential serotype-associated m/z loci are listed. Furthermore, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine were used for modelling to identify the two important serotypes, and the results of cross-validation indicated that they had similar to 80% confidence to make the right classification.

However, most of the studies reported in literature only consider very traditional machine learning methods on small datasets that contain a limited number of species. In this paper we present benchmarking results on an unprecedented scale for a wide range of machine learning methods, using datasets that contain almost 100,000 spectra and more than 1000 different species. The size and the diversity of the data allow to compare three important identification scenarios that are often not distinguished in literature, i.e., identification for novel biological replicates, novel strains and novel species that are not present in the training data. The results demonstrate that in all three scenarios acceptable identification rates are obtained, but the numbers are typically lower than those reported in studies with a more limited analysis. Using hierarchical classification methods, we also demonstrate that taxonomic information is in general not well preserved in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data. For the novel species scenario, we apply for the first time neural networks with Monte Carlo dropout, which have shown to be successful in other domains, such as computer vision, for the detection of novel species.

However, sequencing of all isolates is associated with high costs and a considerable workload. Thus, there is a need for a straightforward complementary tool to prioritize isolates to sequence. In this study, we proposed to investigate the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to pre-screen C. jejuni genetic diversity in comparison to MLST and cgMLST. A panel of 126 isolates, with 10 clonal complexes (CC), 21 sequence types (ST) and 42 different complex types (CT) determined by the SeqSphere+ cgMLST, were analysed by a MALDI Biotyper, resulting into one average spectra per isolate. Concordance and discriminating ability were evaluated based on protein profiles and different cut-offs. A random forest algorithm was trained to predict STs. With a 94% similarity cut-off, an AWC of 1.000, 0.933 and 0.851 was obtained for MLSTCC, MLSTST and cgMLST profile, respectively. The random forest classifier showed a sensitivity and specificity up to 97.5% to predict four different STs.

Unfortunately, conventional and molecular serotyping is expensive and technically demanding. This study aimed to determine the ability of matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to discriminate between pneumococcal serotypes and genotypes (defined by global pneumococcal sequence cluster, GPSC). In this study, MALDI-TOF mass spectra were generated for a diverse panel of whole genome sequenced pneumococcal isolates using the bioMerieux VITEK MS in clinical diagnostic (IVD) mode. Discriminatory mass peaks were identified and hierarchical clustering was performed to visually assess discriminatory ability. Random forest and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were used to formally determine how well serotypes and genotypes were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. Results One hundred and ninety-nine pneumococci, comprising 16 serotypes and non-typeable isolates from 46 GPSC, were analysed. In the primary experiment, hierarchical clustering revealed poor congruence between MALDI-TOF mass spectrum and serotype. The correct serotype was identified from MALDI-TOF mass spectrum in just 14.6% (random forest) or 35.4% (CART) of 130 isolates. Restricting the dataset to the nine dominant GPSC (61 isolates / 13 serotypes), discriminatory ability improved slightly: the correct serotype was identified in 21.3% (random forest) and 41.0% (CART). Finally, analysis of 69 isolates of three dominant serotype-genotype pairs (6B-GPSC1, 19F-GPSC23, 23F-GPSC624) resulted in the correct serotype identification in 81.1% (random forest) and 94.2% (CART) of isolates. Conclusions This work suggests that MALDI-TOF is not a useful technique for determination of pneumococcal serotype. MALDI-TOF mass spectra appear more associated with isolate genotype, which may still have utility for future pneumococcal surveillance activities.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"Streptococcus pneumoniae; Serotype; Genotype; MALDI-TOF; Mass

COVID-19 diagnosis became a priority so as to isolate and treat infected individuals in order to break the contamination chain. Currently, the reference test for COVID-19 diagnosis is the molecular detection (RT-qPCR) of the virus from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. Although this sensitive and specific test remains the gold standard, it has several limitations, such as the invasive collection method, the relative high cost and the duration of the test. Moreover, the material shortage to perform tests due to the discrepancy between the high demand for tests and the production capacities puts additional constraints on RT-qPCR. Here, we propose a PCR-free method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling and machine learning (ML) models from salivary samples. Kinetic saliva samples were collected at enrollment and ten and thirty days later (D0, D10 and D30), to assess the classification performance of the ML models compared to the molecular tests performed on NPS specimens. Spectra were generated using an optimized protocol of saliva collection and successive quality control steps were developed to ensure the reliability of spectra. A total of 360 averaged spectra were included in the study. At D0, the comparison of MS spectra from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 105) with healthy healthcare controls (n = 51) revealed nine peaks that significantly distinguished the two groups. Among the five ML models tested, support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM-LK) provided the best performance on the training dataset (accuracy = 85.2%, sensitivity = 85.1%, specificity = 85.3%, F1-Score = 85.1%). The application of the SVM-LK model on independent datasets confirmed its performances with 88.9% and 80.8% of correct classification for samples collected at D0 and D30, respectively. Conversely, at D10, the proportion of correct classification had fallen to 64.3%. The analysis of saliva samples by MALDI-TOF MS and ML appears as an interesting supplementary tool for COVID-19 diagnosis, despite the mitigated results obtained for convalescent patients (D10).",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,COVID-19; saliva; diagnostic; MALDI-TOF MS; machine learning

The model was evaluated on a prospective test and four external clinical sites. For the data set comprising 20,359 clinical isolates, the area under the receiver operating curve of the classification model was 0.78 to 0.88. These results were further interpreted using shapely additive explanations and presented using the pseudogel method.

Recently it was introduced to analysis of eukaryotic cells, including cancer and stem cells. Besides targeted metabolomic and proteomic applications, the intact cell MALDI TOF mass spectrometry provides a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to discriminate cell types, isogenous cell lines or even the metabolic states. This makes the intact cell MALDI TOF mass spectrometry a promising tool for quality control in advanced cell cultures with a potential to reveal batch -to -batch variation, aberrant clones, or unwanted shifts in cell phenotype. However, cellular alterations induced by change in expression of a single gene has not been addressed by intact cell mass spectrometry yet. In this work we used a well -characterized human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 with silenced expression of a tumor suppressor candidate 3 gene (TUSC3). TUSC3 is involved in co -translational N-glycosylation of proteins with well-known global impact on cell phenotype. Altogether, this experimental design represents a highly suitable model for optimization of intact cell mass spectrometry and analysis of spectral data. Here we investigated five machine learning algorithms (k -nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, partial least squares discrimination, and artificial neural network) and optimized their performance either in pure populations or in two -component mixtures composed of cells with normal or silenced expression of TUSC3. All five algorithms reached accuracy over 90 % and were able to reveal even subtle changes in mass spectra corresponding to alterations of TUSC3 expression. In summary, we demonstrate that spectral fingerprints generated by intact cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry coupled to a machine learning classifier can reveal minute changes induced by alteration of a single gene, and therefore contribute to the portfolio of quality control applications in routine cell and tissue cultures.",English,Green Published,Article,"Intact cell MALDI TOF MS; Machine learning; Biotyping; TUSC3; R

Due to improper antibiotic administration, the prevalence of CRKP infection has been increasing considerably. In recent years, the utilization of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has enabled the identification of bacterial isolates at the families and species level. Moreover, machine learning (ML) classifiers based on MALDI-TOF MS have been recently considered a novel method to detect clinical antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.MethodsA total of 2683 isolates (369 CRKP cases and 2314 carbapenem-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae [CSKP]) collected in the clinical laboratories of Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH) were included in this study, and 80% of data was split into the training data set that were submitted for the ML model. The remaining 20% of data was used as the independent data set for external validation. In this study, we established an artificial neural network (ANN) model to analyze all potential peaks on mass spectrum simultaneously.ResultsOur artificial neural network model for detecting CRKP isolates showed the best performance of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.91) and of area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC = 0.90).

With better generalization abilities, our artificial neural network model can serve as a reliable screening tool for CRKP isolates in clinical practice. Integrating our model into the current workflow of clinical laboratories can assist the rapid identification of CRKP before the completion of traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

We report four cases of primary cutaneous Aspergillus flavus infections in premature newborns linked to incubators contamination by putative clonal strains. Our objective was to evaluate the ability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight (MALDI-TOF) coupled to convolutional neural network (CNN) for clone recognition in a context where only a very small number of strains are available for machine learning. Clinical and environmental A. flavus isolates (n = 64) were studied, 15 were epidemiologically related to the four cases. All strains were typed using microsatellite length polymorphism. We found a common genotype for 9/15 related strains. The isolates of this common genotype were selected to obtain a training dataset (6 clonal isolates/25 non-clonal) and a test dataset (3 clonal isolates/31 non-clonal), and spectra were analysed with a simple CNN model. On the test dataset using CNN model, all 31 non-clonal isolates were correctly classified, 2/3 clonal isolates were unambiguously correctly classified, whereas the third strain was undetermined (i.e., the CNN model was unable to discriminate between GT8 and non-GT8).

The Bacillus genus comprises several closely related groups of species. The rapid classification of these remains challenging using existing methods. Techniques based on MALDI-TOF MS data analysis hold significant promise for fast and precise microbial strains classification at both the genus and species levels. In previous work, we proposed a geometric approach to Bacillus strain classification based on mass spectra analysis via the centroid method (CM). One limitation of such methods is the noise in MS spectra. In this study, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAE) to improve bacteria classification accuracy under noisy MS spectra conditions. We employed a denoising autoencoder approach to convert noisy MS spectra into latent variables representing molecular patterns in the original MS data, and the Random Forest method to classify bacterial strains by latent variables. Comparison of the DAE-RF with the CM method using the artificially noisy test samples showed that DAE-RF offers higher noise robustness. Hence, the DAE-RF method could be utilized for noise-robust, fast, and neat classification of Bacillus species according to MALDI-TOF MS data.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"classification of Bacillus species; MALDI-TOF; denoising autoencoder;

Results: The LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in predicting antimicrobial resistance for most tier 1 antibiotics among oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA) compared with all S. aureus and oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (OSSA) in both databases. In DRIAMS, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was associated with excellent predictive performance, expressed as accuracy/AUROC/AUPR, for clindamycin (0.74/0.81/0.90), tetracycline (0.86/0.87/0.94), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0.95/0.72/0.97). In the CS database, Ada and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) showed excellent performance for erythromycin (0.97/0.92/0.86) and tetracycline (0.68/0.79/0.86). Mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) features of 2411-2414 and 2429-2432 correlated with clindamycin resistance, whereas 5033-5036 was linked to erythromycin resistance in DRIAMS. In the CS database, overlapping features of 2423-2426, 4 496-4 499, and 3764-3767 simultaneously predicted the presence of mecA and oxacillin resistance. Conclusion: The predictive performance of antimicrobial resistance against S. aureus using MALDI-TOF MS depends on database characteristics and the ML algorithm selected. Specific and overlapping mass spectra features are excellent predictive markers for mecA and specific antimicrobial resistance.

MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry is an ultra-sensitive, ultra-fast, low-cost, high-throughput technology that has the potential to achieve this goal, allowing human phenotype characterization and thus phenomic screening for multiple disease states. In this review, we will discuss the main advances achieved so far, putting forward targeted applications of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry in the service of human disease detection. This review focuses on the methodological workflow as MALDI-ToF data processing for phenomic analysis, using state-of-the-art bioinformatic pipelines and software tools. The role of mathematical modelling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence algorithms for disease screening are considered. Moreover, we present some previously developed tools for disease diagnostics and screening based on MALDI-ToF analysis. We discuss the remaining challenges that are ahead when implementing MALDI-ToF into clinical laboratories. Differentiating a standard profile from a single disease phenotype is challenging, but the potential to simultaneously run multiple algorithm screens for different disease phenotypes may only be limited by computing power once this initial hurdle is overcome. The ability to explore the full potential of human clinical phenomics may be closer than imagined; this review gives an insight into the benefits this technology may reap for the future of clinical diagnostics.",English,,Review,"Mass spectrometry; MALDI ToF; phenomics; machine learning;

However, current solutions need time-costly preprocessing steps, are difficult to reproduce due to hyperparameter tuning, are hardly interpretable, and do not pay attention to epidemiological differences inherent to data coming from different centres, which can be critical. We propose using a multi-view heterogeneous Bayesian model (KSSHIBA) for the prediction of AR using MALDI-TOF MS data together with their epidemiological differences. KSSHIBA is the first model that removes the ad-hoc preprocessing steps that work with raw MALDI-TOF data. In addition, due to its Bayesian probabilistic nature, it does not require hyperparameter tuning, provides interpretable results, and allows exploiting local epidemiological differences between data sources. To test the proposal, we used data from 402 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates coming from two different domains and 20 different hospitals located in Spain and Portugal. KSSHIBA outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in antibiotic susceptibility prediction, obtaining a 0.78 AUC score in Wild Type classification and a 0.90 AUC score in Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)+Carbapenemases (CP)-producers. The proposal consistently removes the need for ad-hoc preprocessing by working with raw MALDI-TOF data, which, in turn, reduces the time needed to obtain the results of the resistance mechanism in microbiological laboratories.

The study involved 461 patients with monomicrobial bloodstream infections. Species identification was performed using the conventional MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper system and the Rapid Sepsityper protocol. The data underwent preprocessing steps, and ML models were trained using preprocessed MALDI-TOF data and corresponding labels. The interpretability of the model was enhanced using SHapely Additive exPlanations values to identify significant features. In total, 44 S. aureus isolates comprising 406 MALDI-TOF MS files and 126 K. pneumoniae isolates comprising 1249 MALDI-TOF MS files were evaluated. This study demonstrated the feasibility of predicting MRSA among S. aureus and CRKP among K. pneumoniae isolates using MALDI-TOF MS and Sepsityper. Accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and F1 score for MRSA/methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were 0.875, 0.898 and 0.904, respectively; for CRKP/carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae, these values were 0.766, 0.828 and 0.795, respectively. In conclusion, the novel ML-based MALDI-TOF MS approach enables rapid identification of MRSA and CRKP from flagged blood cultures within 1 h. This enables earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy, reducing deaths due to sepsis. The favourable performance and reduced turnaround time of this method suggest its potential as a rapid detection strategy in clinical microbiology laboratories, ultimately improving patient outcomes.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

Currently, methods for efficient differentiation between classic K. pneumoniae (cKP) and hvKP strains are not available, often causing delay in diagnosis and treatment of hvKP infections. To address this issue, we devised a Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) approach for rapid identification of K1 hvKP strains. Four standard algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA), support vector machine (SVM), supervised neural network (SNN), and quick classifier (QC), were tested for their power to differentiate between K1 and non -K1 strains, among which SVM was the most reliable algorithm. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves of the interest peaks generated by the SVM model was found to confer highly accurate detection sensitivity and specificity, consistently producing distinguishable profiles for K1 hvKP and non -K1 strains. Of the 43 K. pneumoniae modeling strains tested by this approach, all were correctly identified as K1 hvKP and non-K1 capsule type. Of the 20 non-K1 and 17 K1 hvKP validation isolates, the accuracy of K1 hvKP and non-K1 identification was 94.1 and 90.0%, respectively, according to the SVM model.

However, multiple fungal coinfections might occur in clinical practice. Some fungi involved in coinfection, such as Candida krusei and Candida auris, are intrinsically resistant to certain drugs. Identifying intrinsically resistant fungi from coinfected mixed cultures is extremely important for clinical treatment because different treatment options would be pursued accordingly. In this study, we counted the peaks of various species generated by Bruker Daltonik MALDI Biotyper software and accordingly constructed a modified naive Bayesian classifier to analyze the presence of C. krusei and C. auris in simulated mixed samples. When reasonable parameters were fixed, the modified naive Bayesian classifier effectively identified C. krusei and C. auris in the mixed samples (sensitivity 93.52%, specificity 92.5%).

However, the current technique needs bacterial culture to obtain purified single colonies for MS analysis. It is also limited in direct bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) analysis. The two limitations restrict fast clinical diagnosis of bacterial infectious diseases and the choice of suitable antibiotic drugs in a timely manner. In the past years, we focus on bacterial identification and bacterial AMR analysis by MALDI-TOF MS, and developed a number of new methods with respect to sample pretreatment, mass spectrometry data acquisition and mass spectrometry data mining, with the aim of more accurate and more rapid bacterial identification as well as direct bacterial AMR analysis. Microfluidic chips and functional nanomaterials can be used to extract bacterial cells directly from the raw materials to shorten or even avoid the bacterial culture step. In some sample, the total bacterial cell amount is limited and hence it is necessary to further enhance the MS analysis sensitivity, and the single cell mass spectrometry techniques may play an important role in bacterial identification in the future. In view of bacterial AMR analysis, it is necessary to collect more molecular information of bacterial cells by mass spectrometry and to develop advanced data mining strategies based on machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Traditional culturing methods require up to 96 h, including 72 h for bacterial growth, identification with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization timeof-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) through protein profile analysis, and 24 h for antibiotic susceptibility testing. In this study, we aimed at developing an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) by integrating MALDI-TOF MS and machine learning to quickly identify levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance in SM, optimizing treatment decisions. Methods: We selected 8,662 SM from 165,299 MALDI-TOF MS-analysed bacterial specimens, collected from a major medical centre and four secondary hospitals. We exported mass-to-charge values and intensity spectral profiles from MALDI-TOF MS .mzML files to predict antibiotic susceptibility testing results, obtained with the VITEK-2 system using machine learning algorithms. We optimized the models with GridSearchCV and 5-fold cross-validation. Results: We identified distinct spectral differences between resistant and susceptible SM strains, demonstrating crucial resistance features. The machine learning models, including random forest, light-gradient boosting machine, and XGBoost, exhibited high accuracy. We established an AI-CDSS to offer healthcare professionals swift, data-driven advice on antibiotic use. Conclusions: MALDI-TOF MS and machine learning integration into an AI-CDSS significantly improved rapid SM resistance detection. This system reduced the identification time of resistant strains from 24 h to minutes after MALDI-TOF MS identification, providing timely and data-driven guidance. Combining MALDI-TOF MS with machine learning could enhance clinical decision-making and improve SM infection treatment outcomes. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

The rapid and precise identification of this resistance is crucial for effective clinical treatment. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been used for antibiotic susceptibility differentiation of some bacteria in recent years, the genetic diversity of P. aeruginosa complicates population analysis. Rapid identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in P. aeruginosa based on a large amount of MALDI-TOF-MS data has not yet been reported. In this study, we employed publicly available datasets for P. aeruginosa, which contain data on bacterial resistance and MALDI-TOF-MS spectra. We introduced a deep neural network model, synergized with a strategic sampling approach (SMOTEENN) to construct a predictive framework for AMR of three widely used antibiotics.Results The framework achieved area under the curve values of 90%, 85%, and 77% for Tobramycin, Cefepime, and Meropenem, respectively, surpassing conventional classifiers. Notably, random forest algorithm was used to assess the significance of features and post-hoc analysis was conducted on the top 10 features using Cohen's d. This analysis revealed moderate effect sizes (d = 0.5-0.8) in Tobramycin and Cefepime models.

Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) approaches may be useful in bridging the gap between low-resolution phenotypic methods and bulky genotypic methods in the goal of epidemiological source-typing of microbes. Burkholderia has been shown to be identifiable at the subspecies level using MALDI-TOF MS. There have not yet been studies assessing the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to source-type Burkholderia contaminans isolates into epidemiologically relevant outbreak clusters. Methods: 55 well-characterised B. contaminans isolates were used to create a panel for analysis of MALDI-TOF MS biomarker peaks and their relation to outbreak strains, location, source, patient, diagnosis and isolate genetics. Unsupervised clustering was performed and classification models were generated using biostatistical analysis software. Results: B. contaminans spectra derived from MALDI-TOF MS were of sufficiently high resolution to identify 100% of isolates. Unsupervised clustering methods showed poor evidence of spectra clustering by all characteristics measured. Classification algorithms were discriminatory, with Genetic Algorithm models showing 100% recognition capability for all outbreaks, the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typeability model, and 96.63% recognition for the location model. A consistent peak at m/z of approximately 6943 was identified in all non-typeable strains but in none of the typeable strains. Conclusions: MALDI-TOF MS successfully discriminates B. contaminans isolates into clonal, epidemiological clusters, and can recognise isolates non-typeable by PFGE. Further work should investigate this capability, and include peptide studies and genomic sequencing to identify individual proteins or genes responsible for this nontypeablity, particularly at the peak weight identified.",English,Green Accepted,Article,MALDI-TOF; Burkholderia; Rapid diagnostics; Outbreak

However, rapid identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli based on a large amount of MALDI-TOF MS data has not yet been reported. This may be because building a prediction model to cover all E. coli isolates would be challenging given the high diversity of the E. coli population. This study aimed to develop a MALDI-TOF MS-based, data-driven, two-stage framework for characterizing different AMRs in E. coli. Specifically, amoxicillin (AMC), ceftazidime (CAZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), ceftriaxone (CRO), and cefuroxime (CXM) were used. In the first stage, we split the data into two groups based on informative peaks according to the importance of the random forest. In the second stage, prediction models were constructed using four different machine learning algorithms-logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The findings demonstrate that XGBoost outperformed the other four machine learning models. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.62, 0.72, 0.87, 0.72, and 0.72 for AMC, CAZ, CIP, CRO, and CXM, respectively. This implies that a data-driven, two-stage framework could improve accuracy by approximately 2.8%. As a result, we developed AMR prediction models for E. coli using a data-driven two-stage framework, which is promising for assisting physicians in making decisions. Further, the analysis of informative peaks in future studies could potentially reveal new insights. IMPORTANCE Based on a large amount of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) clinical data, comprising 37,918 Escherichia coli isolates, a data-driven two-stage framework was established to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of E. coli. Five antibiotics, including amoxicillin (AMC), ceftazidime (CAZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), ceftriaxone (CRO), and cefuroxime (CXM), were considered for the two-stage model training, and the values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were 0.62 for AMC, 0.72 for CAZ, 0.87 for CIP, 0.72 for CRO, and 0.72 for CXM. Further investigations revealed that the informative peak m/z 9714 appeared with some important peaks at m/z 6809, m/z 7650, m/z 10534, and m/z 11783 for CIP and at m/z 6809, m/z 10475, and m/z 8447 for CAZ, CRO, and CXM.

Specifically, MALDI-TOF-MS is applied on samples that usually include bacterial cells, generating representative signals for the various bacterial species. However, for a reliable identification result, a significant amount of biomass is required. For most samples used for diagnostics of infectious diseases, the sample volume is extremely low to obtain the required amount of biomass. Therefore, amplification of the bacterial load is performed by a culturing phase. If the MALDI process could be applied to individual bacteria, it would be possible to circumvent the need for culturing and isolation, accelerating the whole process. In this paper, we briefly describe an implementation of a MALDI-TOF MS procedure in a setting of individual cells and we demonstrate the use of the produced data for the application of pathogen identification. The identification of pathogens (bacterial species) is performed by using machine learning algorithms on the generated single-cell signals. The high predictive performance of the machine learning models indicates that the produced bacterial signatures constitute an informative representation, helpful in distinguishing the different bacterial species. In addition, we reformulate the bacterial species identification problem as a time series classification task by considering the intensity sequences of a given spectrum as time series values.

Here, we used MALDI-TOF MS with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to successfully predict AMR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a priority pathogen with complex AMR mechanisms. The highest performance was achieved for modern beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor drugs, namely, ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam. For these drugs, the model demonstrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.869 and 0.856, specificity of 0.925 and 0.897, and sensitivity of 0.731 and 0.714, respectively. As part of this work, we developed dynamic binning, a feature engineering technique that effectively reduces the high-dimensional feature set and has wide-ranging applicability to MALDI-TOF MS data. Compared to conventional feature engineering approaches, the dynamic binning method yielded highest performance in 7 of 10 antimicrobials. Moreover, we showcased the efficacy of transfer learning in enhancing the AUROC performance for 8 of 11 antimicrobials. By assessing the contribution of features to the model's prediction, we identified proteins that may contribute to AMR mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining AI with MALDI-TOF MS as a rapid AMR diagnostic tool for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key bacterial pathogen that causes significant global morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emerges rapidly in P. aeruginosa and is driven by complex mechanisms.

The collected serum samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to profile the serum peptides, and also subjected to humoral and cellular immune response analyses to obtain typical immunogenicity information. ResultsSignificant difference in serum peptidome profiles by MALDI-TOF MS was observed after vaccination. By supervised statistical analysis, a total of 13 serum MALDI-TOF MS feature peaks were obtained on day 28 and day 42 of vaccination. The feature peaks were identified as component C1q receptor, CD59 glycoprotein, mannose-binding protein C, platelet basic protein, CD99 antigen, Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein, integral membrane protein 2B, platelet factor 4 and hemoglobin subunits. Combining with immunogenicity analysis, the study provided evidence for the humoral and cellular immune responses activated by CoronaVac. Furthermore, we found that it is possible to distinguish neutralizing antibody (NAbs)-positive from NAbs-negative individuals after complete vaccination using the serum peptidome profiles by MALDI-TOF MS together with machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), linear support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). ConclusionsThe study shows the promise of MALDI-TOF MS-based serum peptidome analysis for the assessment of immune responses activated by COVID-19 vaccination, and discovered a panel of serum peptides biomarkers for COVID-19 vaccination and for NAbs generation. The method developed in this study can help not only in the development of new vaccines, but also in the post-marketing evaluation of developed vaccines.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,COVID-19; vaccine; MALDI-TOF; peptidome; serum; immune response

It is transmitted by sandflies of the subgenus Larroussius. Although Phlebotomus perniciosus is the most important vector in this area, an atypical Ph. perniciosus easily confused with Ph. longicuspis has been observed in North Africa. MALDI-TOF MS, an important tool for vector identification, has recently been applied for the identification of sandflies. Spectral databases presented in the literature, however, include only a limited number of Larroussius species. Our objective was to create an in-house database to identify Mediterranean sandflies and to evaluate the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to discriminate close species or atypical forms within the Larroussius subgenus. Field-caught specimens (n = 94) were identified morphologically as typical Ph. perniciosus (PN; n = 55), atypical Ph. perniciosus (PNA; n = 9), Ph. longicuspis (n = 9), Ph. ariasi (n = 9), Ph. mascittii (n = 3), Ph. neglectus (n = 5), Ph. perfiliewi (n = 1), Ph. similis (n = 9) and Ph. papatasi (n = 2). Identifications were confirmed by sequencing of the mtDNA CytB region and sixteen specimens were included in the in-house database. Blind assessment on 73 specimens (representing 1073 good quality spectra) showed a good agreement (98.5%) between MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification. Discrepancies concerned confusions between Ph. perfiliewi and Ph. perniciosus. Hierarchical clustering did not allow classification of PN and PNA. The use of machine learning, however, allowed discernment between PN and PNA and between the lcus and lcx haplotypes of Ph. longicuspis (accuracy: 0.8938 with partial-least-square regression and random forest models). MALDI-TOF MS is a promising tool for the rapid and accurate identification of field-caught sandflies.

The current reference method for this purpose is multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which is laborious and expensive. Consequently, alternative typing methods are gaining attention, such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Methods: This study sought to analyze MALDI-TOF MS as a typing method using 44 CPKP isolates that were well characterized by MLST. The most common types of samples from which these pathogens were isolated were skin and soft tissues (32%) and urine (29%). Half of the CPKP isolates were from hospitalized patients. Two approaches were followed for the analysis of the mass peak data obtained by MALDI-TOF MS. The first using all peaks obtained and the second using a selection of 21 characteristic peaks. Results: The selection of 21 characteristic peaks showed greater discrimination power for ST11 and ST101. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that this dataset could be efficiently grouped with lineal classifiers. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for this purpose after checking its capacity to classify bacterial strains on the basis of MALDI-TOF MS information. Conclusion: SVM was able to discriminate between ST11 and ST101 with high accuracy. In conclusion, our results reveal MALDI-TOF MS as a promising alternative technique for typing of CPKP isolates.

However, the complexity of hyperparameter tuning limits the practical use, particularly for novices. This study applies these classifiers to identify bacteria using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), offering a rapid and non-invasive alternative to the gold standard, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). An evolutionary algorithm was employed to optimize the hyperparameters of 10 machine learning models.

This approach yielded a test accuracy of 95.8%, 100%, 100% when using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-layer Perceptron models, respectively.

The acquired spectra were analyzed by visual inspection, statistical similarity analysis and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms. Results: Neither visual inspection nor mathematical similarity analysis allowed discrimination between spectra of beta-lactamase-producing and the nonproducing strains, but classification within a species by SVM-based algorithms could achieve a correct classification rate of up to 70%.

In agreement with former studies, a negative impact of short storage periods was stated. Other studies reported inferior mass spectra quality from samples fixated in varying ethanol concentrations. Therefore, sediment samples from a mudflat sampling site in the North Sea were stored under different temperature conditions to explore possible storage effects. Samples were fixated with either 70 or 100% ethanol and specimens were measured using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 12 weeks. The changes in number of peaks per species and the ability to identify specimens based on mass spectra were analyzed quality measurements. We show that storage temperature had a major impact on data quality, as for some species a loss of up to 50% of mass peaks and an increase of failed measurements to over 70% was observed. However, the effect of different ethanol concentrations on data quality was negligible. Concluding from these results, storage of metazoan samples in general and, particularly, of sediment samples at low temperatures of around -25 degrees C is recommended to receive high-quality mass spectra for specimen identification.",English,"Green Accepted, gold",Article,"meiobenthos; proteome fingerprint; MALDI-TOF MS; species identification;

These infections are commonly treated with fluconazole, an antifungal agent targeting the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. Current Antifungal Susceptibility Testing (AFST) methods are time-consuming and are often subjective. Moreover, they cannot reliably detect the tolerance phenomenon, a breeding ground for the resistance. An alternative to the classical AFST methods could use Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass spectrometry (MS). This tool, already used in clinical microbiology for microbial species identification, has already offered promising results to detect antifungal resistance on non-azole tolerant yeasts. Here, we propose a machine-learning approach, adapted to MALDI-TOF MS data, to qualitatively detect fluconazole resistance in the azole tolerant species C. albicans. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were acquired from 33 C. albicans clinical strains isolated from 15 patients. Those strains were exposed for 3 h to 3 fluconazole concentrations (256, 16, 0 mu g/mL) and with (5 mu g/mL) or without cyclosporin A, an azole tolerance inhibitor, leading to six different experimental conditions. We then optimized a protein extraction protocol allowing the acquisition of high-quality spectra, which were further filtered through two quality controls. The first one consisted of discarding not identified spectra and the second one selected only the most similar spectra among replicates. Quality-controlled spectra were divided into six sets, following the sample preparation's protocols. Each set was then processed through an R based script using pre-defined housekeeping peaks allowing peak spectra positioning. Finally, 32 machine-learning algorithms applied on the six sets of spectra were compared, leading to 192 different pipelines of analysis. We selected the most robust pipeline with the best accuracy. This LDA model applied to the samples prepared in presence of tolerance inhibitor but in absence of fluconazole reached a specificity of 88.89% and a sensitivity of 83.33%, leading to an overall accuracy of 85.71%.

10.2147/IDR.S470821,INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE,2024,Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System in Infectious Disease Control: Combatting Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae with Machine Learning,"Jian, MJ","Purpose: The World Health Organization has identified Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) as a significant threat to global public health. The rising threat of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) leads to prolonged hospital stays and higher medical costs, necessitating faster diagnostic methods. Traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) methods demand at least 4 days, requiring 3 days on average for culturing and isolating the bacteria and identifying the species using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), plus an extra day for interpreting AST results. This lengthy process makes traditional methods too slow for urgent clinical situations requiring rapid decision-making, potentially hindering prompt treatment decisions, especially for fast-spreading infections such as those caused by CRKP. This research leverages a cutting-edge diagnostic method that utilizes an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS). It incorporates machine learning algorithms for the swift and precise detection of carbapenem-resistant and colistin-resistant strains. Patients and Methods: We selected 4307 KP samples out of a total of 52,827 bacterial samples due to concerns about multi-drug resistance using MALDI-TOF MS and Vitek-2 systems for AST. It involved thorough data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training fine-tuned with GridSearchCV and 5-fold cross-validation, resulting in high predictive accuracy, as demonstrated by the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (AUC) scores, laying the groundwork for our AI-CDSS. Results: MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed distinct intensity profiles differentiating CRKP and susceptible strains, as well as colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CoRKP) and susceptible strains. The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior discriminatory power, with an AUC of 0.96 for detecting CRKP and 0.98 for detecting CoRKP. Conclusion: Integrating MALDI-TOF MS with machine learning in an AI-CDSS has greatly expedited the detection of KP resistance by approximately 1 day. This system offers timely guidance, potentially enhancing clinical decision-making and improving treatment outcomes for KP infections.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,"carbapenem; colistin; diagnostic accuracy; antibiotic stewardship;

Although most bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi can be accurately identified with this method, some closely related species still represent a challenge for MALDI-TOF MS. In this study, two MALDI-TOF-based approaches were applied for discrimination at the species-level of isolates belonging to the Cryptococcus neoformans complex, previously characterized by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region: (i) an expanded database was built with 26 isolates from the main Cryptococcus species found in our setting (C. neoformans, C. deneoformans and AFLP3 interspecies hybrids) and (ii) peak analysis and data modeling were applied to the protein spectra of the analyzed Cryptococcus isolates. The implementation of the in-house database did not allow for the discrimination of the interspecies hybrids. However, the performance of peak analysis with the application of supervised classifiers (partial least squares-discriminant analysis and support vector machine) in a two-step analysis allowed for the 96.95% and 96.55% correct discrimination of C. neoformans from the interspecies hybrids, respectively. In addition, PCA analysis prior to support vector machine (SVM) provided 98.45% correct discrimination of the three analyzed species in a one-step analysis.

Methods: Identification of isolates (n 1/4 868) was done with MALDI-TOF MS using both commercial and in-house libraries. To determine azole susceptibility, the EUCAST E.Def. 9.3.2 method was applied as the reference standard. Identification of resistant isolates was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Protein spectra obtained by MALDI-TOF MS were analysed to differentiate species within the A. fumigatus complex and to detect azole-resistant A. fumigatus sensu stricto isolates. Results: Correct discrimination of A. fumigatus sensu stricto from cryptic species was accomplished in 100% of the cases applying principal component analysis (PCA) to protein spectra generated by MALDI-TOF MS. Furthermore, a specific peak (4586 m/z) was found to be present only in cryptic species. The application of partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analysis allowed 98.43% (+/- 0.038) discrimination between susceptible and azole-resistant A. fumigatus sensu stricto isolates. Finally, based on PLS and SVM, A. fumigatus sensu stricto isolates with different cyp51A gene mutations were correctly clustered in 91.5% of the cases. Conclusions: MALDI-TOF MS combined with peak analysis is a novel tool that allows the differentiation of A. fumigatus sensu stricto from other species within the A. fumigatus complex, as well as the detection of azole-resistant A. fumigatus sensu stricto. Although further studies are still needed, the results reported here show the great potential of MALDI-TOF and machine learning for the rapid detection of azoleresistant Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from clinical origins.

We propose the application of MALDI-TOF MS as a dual technique for the identification of bacteria and the detection of resistance, with no extra hands-on procedures. We have developed a machine learning approach that uses the random forest algorithm for the direct prediction of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPK) isolates, based on the spectra of complete cells. For this purpose, we used a database of 4,547 mass spectra profiles, including 715 unduplicated clinical isolates that are represented by 324 CPK with 37 different ST. The impact of the culture medium was determinant in the CPK prediction, being that the isolates were tested and cultured in the same media, compared to the isolates used to build the model (blood agar). The proposed method has an accuracy of 97.83% for the prediction of CPK and an accuracy of 95.24% for the prediction of OXA-48 or KPC carriage. For the CPK prediction, the RF algorithm yielded a value of 1.00 for both the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall curve. The contribution of individual mass peaks to the CPK prediction was determined using Shapley values, which revealed that the complete proteome, rather than a series of mass peaks or potential biomarkers (as previously suggested), is responsible for the algorithm-based classification. Thus, the use of the full spectrum, as proposed here, with a pattern-matching analytical algorithm produced the best outcome. The use of MALDI-TOF MS coupled with machine learning algorithm processing enabled the identification of CPK isolates within only a few minutes, thereby reducing the time to detection of resistance.

A total of 830 CRKP and 1462 carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) isolates were collected; 54 ColRKP isolates and 1592 colistin-intermediate K. pneumoniae (ColIKP) isolates were also included. Routine MALDI-TOF MS, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, NG-Test CARBA 5, and resistance gene detection were followed by machine learning (ML). Using the ML model, the accuracy and area under the curve for differentiat-ing CRKP and CSKP were 0.8869 and 0.9551, respectively, and those for ColRKP and ColIKP were 0.8361 and 0.8447, respectively. The most important MS features of CRKP and ColRKP were m/z 4520-4529 and m/z 4170-4179, respectively. Of the CRKP isolates, MS m/z 4520-4529 was a potential biomarker for dis-tinguishing KPC from OXA, NDM, IMP, and VIM. Of the 34 patients who received preliminary CRKP ML prediction results (by texting), 24 (70.6%) were confirmed to have CRKP infection. The mortality rate was lower in patients who received antibiotic regimen adjustment based on the preliminary ML prediction (4/14, 28.6%). In conclusion, the proposed model can provide rapid results for differentiating CRKP and CSKP, as well as ColRKP and ColIKP. The combination of ML-based CRKP with preliminary reporting of results can help physicians alter the regimen approximately 24 h earlier, resulting in improved survival of patients with timely antibiotic intervention.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

The resulting MALDI-TOF mass spectra also harbour the potential to deliver prediction results for other phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance. However, the development of machine learning algorithms specifically tailored to MALDI-TOF MS-based phenotype prediction is still in its infancy. Moreover, current spectral pre-processing typically involves a parameter-heavy chain of operations without analyzing their influence on the prediction results. In addition, classification algorithms lack quantification of uncertainty, which is indispensable for predictions potentially influencing patient treatment. Results: We present a novel prediction method for antimicrobial resistance based on MALDI-TOF mass spectra. First, we compare the complex conventional pre-processing to a new approach that exploits topological information and requires only a single parameter, namely the number of peaks of a spectrum to keep. Second, we introduce PIKE, the peak information kernel, a similarity measure specifically tailored to MALDI-TOF mass spectra which, combined with a Gaussian process classifier, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates about predictions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by predicting antibiotic resistance of three clinically highly relevant bacterial species. Our method consistently outperforms competitor approaches, while demonstrating improved performance and security by rejecting out-of-distribution samples, such as bacterial species that are not represented in the training data. Ultimately, our method could contribute to an earlier and precise antimicrobial treatment in clinical patient care.",English,"hybrid, Green Published",Article; Proceedings Paper,

Subspecies identification of MABC is crucial for adequate treatment due to different antimicrobial resistance properties amid subspecies. However, long incubation days are needed for the traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). Delayed effective antibiotics administration often causes unfavorable outcomes. Thus, we proposed a novel approach to identify subspecies and potential antibiotic resistance, guiding early and accurate treatment. Subspecies of MABC isolates were determined by secA1, rpoB, and hsp65. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) spectra were analyzed, and informative peaks were detected by random forest (RF) importance. Machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to build models for classifying MABC subspecies based on spectrum. The models were validated by repeated five-fold cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. In total, 102 MABC isolates (52 subspecies abscessus and 50 subspecies massiliense) were analyzed. Top informative peaks including m/z 6715, 4739, etc. were identified.

Thus, identifying MABS's subspecies (M. abscessus, M. bolletii and M. massiliense) is a clinical necessity for guiding treatment decisions. We aimed to assess the potential of Machine Learning (ML)-based classifiers coupled to Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) MS to identify MABS subspecies. Two spectral databases were created by using 40 confirmed MABS strains. Spectra were obtained by using MALDI-TOF MS from strains cultivated on solid (Columbia Blood Agar, CBA) or liquid (MGIT (R)) media for 1 to 13 days. Each database was divided into a dataset for ML-based pipeline development and a dataset to assess the performance. An in-house programme was developed to identify discriminant peaks specific to each subspecies. The peak-based approach successfully distinguished M. massiliense from the other subspecies for strains grown on CBA. The ML approach achieved 100% accuracy for subspecies identification on CBA, falling to 77.5% on MGIT (R). This study validates the usefulness of ML, in particular the Random Forest algorithm, to discriminate MABS subspecies by MALDI-TOF MS.

The different pathotypes of Escherichia coli can produce a large number of human diseases. Surveillance is complex since their differentiation is not easy. In particular, the detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O157 : H7 consists of stool culture of a diarrhoeal sample on enriched and/or selective media and identification of presumptive colonies and confirmation, which require a certain level of training and are time-consuming and expensive.Hypothesis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time - of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI- TOF MS) is a quick and easy way to obtain the protein spectrum of a microorganism, identify the genus and species, and detect potential biomarker peaks of certain characteristics.Aim. To verify the usefulness of MALDI- TOF MS to rapidly identify and differentiate STEC O157 : H7 from other E. coli pathotypes. Methodology. The direct method was employed, and the information obtained using Microflex LT platform -based analysis from 60 clinical isolates (training set) was used to detect differences between the peptide fingerprints of STEC O157 : H7 and other E. coli strains. The protein profiles detected laid the foundations for the development and evaluation of machine learning predictive models in this study. Results. The detection of potential biomarkers in combination with machine learning predictive models in a new set of 142 samples, called 'test set', achieved 99.3 % (141/142) correct classification, allowing us to distinguish between the isolates of STEC O157 : H7 and the other E. coli group. Great similarity was also observed with respect to this last group and the Shigella species when applying the potential biomarkers algorithm, allowing differentiation from STEC O157 : H7Conclusion. Given that STEC O157 : H7 is the main causal agent of haemolytic uremic syndrome, and based on the performance values obtained in the present study (sensitivity=98.5 % and specificity=100.0 %), the implementation of this technique provides a proof of principle for MALDI- TOF MS and machine learning to identify biomarkers to rapidly screen or confirm STEC O157 : H7 versus other diarrhoeagenic E. coli in the future.",English,,Article,MALDI-TOF; STEC; machine learning; Escherichia coli O157; H7; biomarkers

ObjectiveWe evaluated whether matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) could make it possible to differentiate between high-and low-biofilm-producing microorganisms on 24-h cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. MethodsWe included 157 strains of S. aureus and 91 strains of C. albicans obtained from the blood cultures of patients with bacteremia/candidemia. We tested biofilm production using the CV binding assay as the gold standard to classify strains as low or high biofilm producers. We then applied MALDI-TOF MS to create a machine learning-based predictive model using 40 strains of S. aureus and C. albicans, each with extreme absorbance values, and validated this approach with the remaining 117 and 51 strains using the random forest algorithm and the support vector machine algorithm, respectively.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of identifying yeasts after a short-term incubation on a solid medium. We tested 24 strains of eight Candida species. Blood culture bottles were spiked with a calibrated suspension of each Candida strain. Three different culture media, two types of blood culture bottles and three different incubation time points were tested. A multivariable random-effects logistic regression analysis was performed for determining factors independently associated with a successful MALDI-TOF MS identification. One-hundred and thirty-one out of 432 MALDI-TOF MS analyses (30%) exhibited a score >= 1.7. The performance of the technique varied across Candida species. Factors associated with a successful identification were the use of a chromogenic Candida medium and the time points 4 and 5 h. Using the factors 'chromogenic Candida medium' and time point 5 h the global performance of identification reached 60% and a mean MALDI-TOF score of 1.78. Identifying yeasts after a short-term incubation on a solid medium seems possible, especially when using a chromogenic Candida medium and respecting at least 5 h of incubation.

Because comprehensive reference libraries, especially for metazoans, are rare, we explored the accuracy of unsupervised diversity estimations of communities using MALDI-TOF MS data in the absence of reference libraries to provide a method for future application in ecological research. To discover the best analysis strategy providing high congruence with true community structures, we carried out a simulation with more than 30,000 analyses using different combinations of data transformations, dimensionality reductions, and cluster algorithms. Species profile, Hellinger, and presence/absence transformations were applied to raw data and dimensions were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and uniform manifold approximation and projection. To estimate biodiversity, data were clustered making use of partitioning around medoids, model-based clustering, and K-means clustering. The analyses were carried out on published mass spectrometry data of harpacticoid copepods. Most successful combinations (Hellinger transformation + PCA or raw data + partitioning around medoids) returned good values even for difficult species distributions containing numerous singleton species. Nevertheless, errors occurred most frequently because of such singleton taxa. Hence, replicative sampling in wide sampling areas for analysis is emphasized to increase the minimum number of specimens per species, thus reducing putative sources of errors. Our results demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS data can be used to accurately estimate the biodiversity of unknown communities using unsupervised learning methods. The provided approach allows the biodiversity comparison of sampled regions for which no reference libraries are available. Hence, especially data on groups which demand a time-consuming identification or are highly abundant can be analyzed within short working time, accelerating ecological studies.",English,"Green Published, hybrid",Article,

The objective is to develop pre-symptomatic screening detection of OSCC by a brush biopsy method which is less invasive than the conventional biopsy for histology. Given the molecular heterogeneity of oral cancer, it is unlikely that even a panel of tumour markers would provide accurate diagnosis. Therefore, approaches such as the matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight-mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) allow several biomarkers or peptide profile patterns to be simultaneously assessed. Brush biopsies from 27 patients with histology-proven OSCCs plus 40 biopsies from 10 healthy controls were collected. MALDI-TOF-MS profiling was performed and additional statistical analysis of the data was used to classify the disease status according to the biological behaviour of the lesion. For classification a support vector machine algorithm was trained using spectra of brush biopsy samples to distinguish healthy control patients from patients with histology-proven OSCC. MALDI-TOF-MS was able to distinguish between healthy patients and OSCC patients with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93%. In summary, MALDI-TOF-MS in combination with sophisticated bioinformatic methods can distinguish OSCC patients from non-cancer controls with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Further improvement and validation of this approach is necessary to determine its feasibility to assist the pre-symptomatic detection of head and neck cancer screening in routine daily practice.

Detecting hVISA can guide the correct administration of antibiotics. However, hVISA cannot be detected in most clinical microbiology laboratories because the required diagnostic tools are either expensive, time consuming, or labor intensive. By contrast, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) is a cost-effective and rapid tool that has potential for providing antibiotics resistance information. To analyze complex MALDI-TOF mass spectra, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to generate robust hVISA detection models. In this study, MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained from 35 hVISA/vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and 90 vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. The vancomycin susceptibility of the isolates was determined using an Etest and modified population analysis profile-area under the curve.

Feature engineering used in model construction to improve the quality of the machine learning process can improve the performance of unconventional reservoir estimates. The compositions of petroleum fluids are represented by spectra obtained from various analyses, which vary greatly in shape and dimensions, contain large amounts of data, and cannot be processed as single numbers. Selection of relevant features in the spectra can simplify interpretation, reduce dimensionality, and improve data compatibility. The features have been selected in GC-MS, NMR and MALDI-TOF spectra of bitumen from the Bayan-Erkhet tar sand deposit in Mongolia for comparison with bitumens from other regions of the world. The GC-MS spectra have a similar baseline shape, either a triangle or two humps with peaks eluted to varying degrees. The comparison made it possible to isolate poorly eluted peaks of carbon number groups in the studied bitumen. Since NMR spectra of petroleum fluids are most often published without NMR parameters, simple indices are developed to compare the shapes of the spectra. The values of these indices are consistent with the characteristics of the samples. The sequences of hydrocarbon compounds determined in the MALDI-TOF spectrum are very similar to those of the Banik black shale, Iraq, which allowed to clarify the sequences.

We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles of clinical isolates.

We therefore aimed to establish an accurate identification system for differential diagnosis of mastitis associated Streptococcus spp. and related species using biophysical techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and MALDI - TOF/MS. Results: Based on a panel of 210 isolates from cases of bovine mastitis, an unsupervised FTIR spectral reference library was established and an artificial neural network (ANN) - assisted identification system was developed. All bacterial isolates were previously identified by species-specific PCR and/or 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. An overall identification rate of 100% at species level for 173 strains unknown to the ANN and the library was achieved by combining ANN and the spectral database, thus demonstrating the suitability of our FTIR identification system for routine diagnosis. In addition, we investigated the potential of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the identification of mastitis associated Streptococcus spp. and related bacteria. Using the Microflex LT System, MALDI Biotyper software (TM) (V3.3) we achieved an accuracy rate of 95.2%. A blind study, including 21 clinical samples from dairy cows, revealed a 100% correct species identification rate for FTIR and 90.5% for MALDI-TOF MS, indicating that these techniques are valuable tools for diagnosis. Conclusions: This study clearly demonstrates that FTIR spectroscopy as well as MALDI-TOF MS can significantly improve and facilitate the identification and differentiation of mastitis associated Streptococcus spp. and related species.

Methods: MALDI-TOF profiling of peptides bound to serum albumin (""albuminome'') was performed using 90 mu L of serum from 45 study subjects (HCV-related cirrhosis, small, unifocal HCCs and advanced HCCs). To overcome the large intra-sample variability, a Quality Assurance protocol was implemented, and 4-8 samples for each subject were processed and analyzed. Overall, 522 subject samples and 299 quality-control spectra were analyzed. A machine-learning approach (Random Forest) was applied to analyze the data sets. Results: Mean intra-sample coefficient of variation (CV) of the analytical procedure was 17.6%-30.0%; inter-subject CV was in the range 48.8%-71.3% among the three study groups. The Random Forest procedure correctly classified 433/522 ""patient samples'' and 295/299 ""reference samples''; 43/45 patients were correctly classified following this approach.

We designed and set-up a MALDI-TOF MS-based assay to identify the most isolated and emerging therapy-refractory/uncommon fungi from cystic fibrosis (CF) and immunocompromised patients. Two-hundred and thirty isolates from 10 different genera (Aspergillus, Emericella, Fusarium, Geosmithia, Neosartorya, Penicillium, Pseudallescheria, Scedosporium, Talaromyces, Fomitopsis), investigated during routine diagnostic efforts, were correlated to 22 laboratory-adapted reference MALDI-TOF MS ""proteomic phenotypes"". A growth time-course at 30 degrees C on Sabouraud agar medium was performed for the 22 ""phenotypes"" at 48, 72, 96 and 120 h points. The best peptide extraction conditions for full recovery of conidia- or asci-producing multihyphal morph structures and the highest intra- and inter-class profiling correlation were identified for the 120 h point spectra dataset, from which an engineered library derived (pre-analytical phase). Fingerprinting classifiers, selected by Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis algorithm, were computed by Genetic Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Supervised Neuronal Network and Quick Classifier model construction.

Its early detection is key for a good prognosis and even curative surgery. However, current medical examination methods and tests have been inefficient in detecting ovarian cancer at the early stage, leading to preventable death. So far, new screening tests based on molecular biomarker analysis techniques have not resulted in any substantial improvement in early-stage diagnosis and increased survival. Thus, whilst there remains clear potential to improve outcomes through early detection, novel approaches are needed. Here, we postulated that MALDI-ToF-mass-spectrometry-based tests can be a solution for effective screening of ovarian cancer. In this retrospective cohort study, we generated and analyzed the mass spectra of 181 serum samples of women with and without ovarian cancer. Using bioinformatics pipelines for analysis, including predictive modeling and machine learning, we found distinct mass spectral patterns composed of 9-20 key combinations of peak intensity or peak enrichment features for each stage of ovarian cancer. Based on a scoring algorithm and obtained patterns, the optimal sensitivity for detecting each stage of cancer was 95-97% with a specificity of 97%. Scoring all algorithms simultaneously could detect all stages of ovarian cancer at 99% sensitivity and 92% specificity. The results further demonstrate that the matrix and mass range analyzed played a key role in improving the mass spectral data quality and diagnostic power. Altogether, with the results reported here and increasing evidence of the MS assay's diagnostic accuracy and instrument robustness, it has become imminent to consider MS in the clinical application for ovarian cancer screening.",English,gold,Article,"mass spectrometry; MALDI-ToF; ovarian cancer; bioinformatics; machine

Currently, however, expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive methods are used for MRSA typing. By contrast, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a potential tool for preliminary lineage typing. The approach has not been standardized, and its performance has not been analyzed in some regions with geographic barriers (e.g., Taiwan Island). Methods: The mass spectra of 306 MRSA isolates were obtained from multiple reference hospitals in Taiwan. The multilocus sequence types (MIST) of the isolates were determined. The spectra were analyzed for the selection of characteristic peaks by using the ClinProTools software. Furthermore, various machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to generate binary and multiclass models for classifying the major MLST types (ST5, ST59, and ST239) of MRSA. Results: A total of 10 peaks with the highest discriminatory power (m/z range: 2,082-6,594) were identified and evaluated. All the single peaks revealed significant discriminatory power during MIST typing. Moreover, the binary and multiclass ML models achieved sufficient accuracy (82.80-94.40% for binary models and >81.00% for multiclass models) in classifying the major MLST types.

Classification algorithms, as a critical part of the MALDI-TOF MS analysis approach, have been developed using both traditional algorithms and machine learning algorithms. In this study, a method that combined helix matrix transformation with a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was presented for bacterial identification. A total of 14 bacterial species including 58 strains were selected to create an in-house MALDI-TOF MS spectrum dataset. The 1D array-type MALDI-TOF MS spectrum data were transformed through a helix matrix transformation into matrix-type data, which was fitted during the CNN training. Through the parameter optimization, the threshold for binarization was set as 16 and the final size of a matrix-type data was set as 25 x 25 to obtain a clean dataset with a small size. A CNN model with three convolutional layers was well trained using the dataset to predict bacterial species. The filter sizes for the three convolutional layers were 4, 8, and 16. The kernel size was three and the activation function was the rectified linear unit (ReLU). A back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was created without helix matrix transformation and a convolution layer to demonstrate whether the helix matrix transformation combined with CNN algorithm works better. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the CNN and BPNN models were 0.98 and 0.87, respectively. The accuracies of the CNN and BPNN models were 97.78 +/- 0.08 and 86.50 +/- 0.01, respectively, with a significant statistical difference (p < 0.001).

Deep Metric Learning models combine Metric Learning to determine the degree of similarity or difference between a set of mass spectra with the generalization power of Deep Learning to improve feature extraction even further. The two most popular of these models combine multiple neural networks with identical architectures and are commonly called Siamese (SNN) and Triplet Neural Networks (TNN). Herein, using both SNNs and TNNs, we intended to taxonomically categorize two sets of previously-validated mass spectra that corresponded to 30 species of Neotropical arthropods in the Culicidae and Ixodidae families, some of which are disease vectors. The effectiveness of SNNs and TNNs to correctly classify 826 spectra from 12 mosquito species and 310 spectra from 18 species of hard ticks was highly effective, with both algorithms performing with minimal average loss during cross-validation. SNNs produced accuracy rates for ticks and mosquitoes of 91.22% and 94.46%, respectively, while accuracy rates of 93% and 99% were obtained with TNNs.

Rapid methods that require minimum sample preparation and rapid data analysis are urgently required. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has recently been used by clinical laboratories for identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; however, discrepancies have arisen regarding biological and technical issues. The aim of this study was to standardize an operating procedure and data analysis for identification of CPK by MALDI-TOF MS. To evaluate this approach, a series of 162 K. pneumoniae isolates (112 CPK and 50 non-CPK) were processed in the MALDI BioTyper system (Bruker Daltonik, Germany) following a standard operating procedure. The study was conducted in two stages; the first is denominated the ""reproducibility stage"" and the second ""CPK identification."" The first stage was designed to evaluate the biological and technical variation associated with the entire analysis of CPK and the second stage to assess the final accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of CPK. Therefore, we present an improved MALDI-TOF MS data analysis pipeline using neural network analysis implemented in Clover MS Data Analysis Software (Clover Biosoft, Spain) that is designed to reduce variability, guarantee interlaboratory reproducibility, and maximize the information selected from the bacterial proteome. Using the random forest (RF) algorithm, 100% of CPK isolates were correctly identified when all the peaks in the spectra were selected as input features and total ion current (TIC) normalization was applied.

This study aimed to compare the ability of nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS to detect rifampicin (RIF) resistance in drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) patients with Xpert MTB/RIF and to analyze the disparate results individually. Additionally, potential factors associated with rifampicin resistance among DR-TB patients in Qingdao were investigated. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at Qingdao Chest Hospital, and patients with DR-TB were enrolled. Corresponding frozen isolates were recovered and subjected to nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS, Xpert MTB/RIF, and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST). Sanger sequencing was performed for the discordant results of nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS and Xpert MTB/RIF. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify potential factors associated with rifampicin resistance among patients with DR-TB. Results: A total of 125 patients with DR-TB (18.8%, 125/668) were enrolled in this study from May 1 to July 31, 2023. Rifampicinresistant (DR-TB/RR, 29) and rifampicin-sensitive (DR-TB/RS, 96) groups were divided according to the pDST results. Nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS performed better than Xpert MTB/RIF in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and agreement with pDST. Only six cases had inconsistent results, and the sequencing results of five cases were identical to nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS. Furthermore, chest pain (aOR=12.84, 95% CI, 2.29-91.97, p=0.005), isoniazid sensitivity (aOR=0.14, 0.02-0.59, p=0.013), and ethambutol sensitivity (aOR=0.02, 0.00-0.10, p=0.000) were potential factors associated with rifampicin resistance among DR-TB patients in Qingdao. Conclusion: The overall concordance between nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS and Xpert MTB/RIF was 95.2%, with the former performing better in determining rifampicin susceptibility among DR-TB cases in Qingdao.

In recent years the interest in saponins has increased significantly because of their diverse properties as natural detergents and foaming agents, their cardiac, immunostimulating, and anti-cancer activity, as well as other health promoting functions. This study deals with metabolitic analysis of saponins from methanolic extracts of fruit mesocarp (ME), seed kernel (KE) and root (RE) of Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Del. (desert date) plant grown in Israel using LC (RI)-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS. The structural assignment was carried out by fragmentation experiments of LC (RI)-ESI/MS and literature data. The study has revealed that, all together, twenty-four furostanol saponins were found in ME, KE and RE. Of these, four saponins are found only in ME, five only in KE and six only in RE. Diosgenin was found to be the sole aglycone in all the saponins. The smallest saponin (MW 740 Da) was found with two sugar units (glucose) and the largest saponin (MW 1678 Da) was found with eight sugar units (5 glucose, 2 rhamnose and 1 xylose) attached to diosgenin. The results suggest that MALDI-TOF/MS with positive ion mode is particularly effective for determining the metabolites of saponins in B. aegyptiaca plant tissues. MALDI-TOF/MS not only verified the results of the LC (RI)-ESI/MS, but also identified additional saponins that are now systematically organized in a database of B. aegyptiaca saponins.",English,,Article,"Balanites aegyptiaca; Metabolite profiling; Saponins; LC-ESI; MS;

In this study, we have employed AI for COVID-19 diagnosis using mass spectrometry (MS) data and leveraged explainable AI (X-AI) to explain the decision -making process on a local (per-sample) and global (all samples) basis. We first assessed eight machine learning models with five feature engineering techniques using a five-fold stratified cross-validation. The best accuracy was achieved by Random Forest (RF) classifier using the ratio of areas under the curve (AUC) from the MS data as features. These features were chosen on the basis of tentatively representing both human and viral proteins in human gargle samples. We evaluated the RF classifier on a 70% - 30% train-test split strategy of 152 human gargle samples, yielding an accuracy of 94.12% on the test dataset. Employing X-AI, we further interpreted the RF model using shapely additive explanations (SHAP) and feature importance techniques, including permutation and impurity-based feature importances. With these interpretation models offering a local and global explanation for the machine learning model decisions, we devised a straightforward, three -stage X-AI framework that can enable medical practitioners to understand the mechanisms of a black-box AI model.

Subsequently, three different classification models were applied to the data of both techniques, PCA-LDA, PCA-kNN, and soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA) as class modelling technique. All monofloral external test set samples were classified correctly by PCA-LDA and SIMCA with both data sets, while multifloral test set samples could only be identified as outliers by the SIMCA technique, which is a crucial aspect in the authenticity control of honey. The comparison of the two used analytical techniques resulted in better overall classification results for the monofloral external test set samples with the MIR spectroscopic data. Additionally, clearly more multifloral external samples were identified as outliers by MIR spectroscopy (91.3%) as compared to MALDI-ToF-MS (78.3%). The results indicate that the high reproducibility of the used MIR technique leads to a generally better ability of separating monofloral honeys and in particular, identifying multifloral honeys.

The diagnosis of human schistosomiasis is mainly based on the microscopic detection of the parasite's eggs in the feces (i.e., for Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum) or urine (i.e., for Schistosoma haematobium) samples. However, these techniques have limited sensitivity, and microscopic expertise is waning outside endemic areas. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become the gold standard diagnostic method for the identification of bacteria and fungi in many microbiological laboratories. Preliminary studies have recently shown promising results for parasite identification using this method. The aims of this study were to develop and validate a species-specific database for adult Schistosoma identification, and to evaluate the effects of different storage solutions (ethanol and RNAlater) on spectra profiles. Methods Adult worms (males and females) of S. mansoni and S. japonicum were obtained from experimentally infected mice. Species identification was carried out morphologically and by cytochrome oxidase 1 gene sequencing. Reference protein spectra for the creation of an in-house MALDI-TOF MS database were generated, and the database evaluated using new samples. We employed unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, and partial least squares discriminant analysis) machine learning algorithms for the identification and differentiation of the Schistosoma species. Results All the spectra were correctly identified by internal validation. For external validation, 58 new Schistosoma samples were analyzed, of which 100% (58/58) were correctly identified to genus level (log score values >= 1.7) and 81% (47/58) were reliably identified to species level (log score values >= 2). The spectra profiles showed some differences depending on the storage solution used. All the machine learning algorithms classified the samples correctly.

We used MALDI-TOF MS to analyze the serum peptidome from 72 patients with COVID-19 (training cohort), clinically classified as mild (28), severe (23), and critical (21), and 20 healthy controls. The resulting matrix of peak intensities was used for Machine Learning (ML) approaches to classify and predict COVID-19 severity of 22 independent patients (validation cohort). Finally, we analyzed all sera by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the most relevant proteins associated with disease severity. Results. We found a clear variability of the serum peptidome profile depending on COVID-19 severity. Forty-two peaks exhibited a log fold change >= 1 and 17 were significantly different and at least 4-fold more intense in the set of critical patients than in the mild ones. The ML approach classified clinical stable patients according to their severity with 100% accuracy and correctly predicted the evolution of the nonstable patients in all cases. The LC-MS/MS identified 5 proteins that were significantly upregulated in the critical patients. They included the serum amyloid protein A2, which probably yielded the most intense peak detected by MALDI-TOF MS. Conclusions. We demonstrate the potential of the MALDI-TOF MS as a bench to bedside technology to aid clinicians in their decision making regarding patients with COVID-19.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,COVID-19; machine learning; MALDI-TOF; serum peptidome

The early treatment and early diagnosis of TNBC are highly important for the survival of TNBC patients. Nevertheless, traditional methods for TNBC diagnosis, i.e. imaging examinations and tissue biopsy, cannot achieve early diagnosis, are invasive and associated with the risk of arousing tumor spreading. Herein, we developed colloidosomes-coupled matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to quantify free serum amino acids for the diagnosis of TNBC. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used to form water-in-oil colloidosomes and to encapsulate deproteinated serum for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. With small sample spot size (200-300 mu m) and densely packed AuNPs monolayer, the dried sample spot from colloidosomes can facilitate MALDI-TOF MS analysis of small molecule metabolites with high sensitivity, high reproducibility and good quantification performance. We used the method to quantify free amino acids in human serum. A cohort of 30 TNBC patients, 30 breast lump patients and 30 healthy controls were recruited for the study. It was found that the concentrations of free amino acids in TNBC patients were significantly lower than that of heathy controls, and the concentrations were also significantly different from that of breast lump patients. Based on the quantities of serum free amino acids, we have built a machine learning-based classification model to differentiate TNBC patients from the controls, including healthy controls and breast lump patients, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 95%, 100% and 97%, respectively. The assay consumes less than 1 mu L serum per analysis, and takes only minutes to analyze a sample. With the advantages of low cost, low sample consumption, high throughput in analysis and high accuracy in identification, the non-invasive liquid biopsy method is promising to be applied to clinical diagnosis of TNBC.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,"Plasmonic colloidosome; MALDI-TOF MS; Triple-negative breast cancer;

This was validated in the USA to CLIA-LDT standards for asymptomatic infection detection remotely via sharing protocols, shipping key reagents, video conferencing, and data exchange. In Brazil, more so than in the UK and USA, there is a need to develop non-PCR-dependent, rapid, and affordable SARS-CoV-2 infection screening tests that also identify variant SARS-CoV-2 and other virus infections. In addition, travel restrictions necessitated remote collaboration with validation on the available clinical MALDI-TOF-the Bruker Biotyper (microflex((R)) LT/SH)-and on nasopharyngeal swab samples, as salivary gargle samples were not available. The Bruker Biotyper was shown to be almost log10(3) more sensitive at the detection of high molecular weight spike proteins. A protocol for saline swab soaks out was developed, and duplicate swab samples collected in Brazil were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The swab collected sample spectra that varied from that of saliva-gargle in three additional mass peaks in the mass region expected for IgG heavy chains and human serum albumin. A subset of clinical samples with additional high mass, probably spike-related proteins, were also found. Further, spectral data comparisons and analysis, subjected to machine learning algorithms in order to resolve RT-qPCR positive from RT-qPCR negative swab samples, showed 56-62% sensitivity, 87-91% specificity, and a 78% agreement with RT-qPCR scoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",English,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",Article,"COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; MALDI-TOF; mass spectrometry; viral screening;

This study aimed to design an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and machine learning for the rapid detection of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) resistance in KP to improve clinical decision-making processes. Methods: Out of 107,721 bacterial samples, 675 specimens of KP with suspected multi-drug resistance were selected. These specimens were collected from a tertiary hospital and four secondary hospitals between 2022 and 2023 to evaluate CZA resistance. We used MALDI-TOF MS and machine learning to develop an AI-CDSS with enhanced speed of resistance detection. Results: Machine learning models, especially light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95, indicating high accuracy. The predictive models formed the core of our newly developed AI-CDSS, enabling clinical decisions quicker than traditional methods using culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing by a day. Conclusions: The study confirms that MALDI-TOF MS, integrated with machine learning, can swiftly detect CZA resistance. Incorporating this insight into an AI-CDSS could transform clinical workflows, giving healthcare professionals immediate, crucial insights for shaping treatment plans. This approach promises to be a template for future anti-resistance strategies, emphasizing the vital importance of advanced diagnostics in enhancing public health outcomes. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Direct (""intact cell"") and sample extraction protocols were also compared. Unsupervised methods (principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis) allowed observing profile distribution modulated according to the used medium. Optical density results and data analysis approaches showed that Mueller Hinton Broth medium was the most suitable considering both adequate bacterial growth and acquisition of bacteria specific MS profiles. As it enabled better differentiation among species, extraction was superior to direct (""intact cell"") method. Four machine learning algorithms were tested, aiming at simultaneous classification of bacteria. Random forest model presented the best performance, providing 100% accuracy in multiclass prediction. RP mode analysis provided more diverse MS profiles, displaying also a potential to be used for identification purposes. Additionally, canonical correlation analysis showed that linear and RP modes showed correlation, suggesting that linear mode profiles may be reflected on RP MS patterns.

We investigated whether patterns of serum peptides could diagnose acute DAT. Serum peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry from 107 sea lions (acute DAT n = 34; non-DAT n = 73). Artificial neural networks (ANN) were trained using MALDI-TOF data. Individual peaks and neural networks were qualified using an independent test set (n = 20). Results: No single peak was a good classifier of acute DAT, and ANN models were the best predictors of acute DAT. Performance measures for a single median ANN were: sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 60%; positive predictive value, 71%; negative predictive value, 100%. When 101 ANNs were combined and allowed to vote for the outcome, the performance measures were: sensitivity, 30%; specificity, 100%; positive predictive value, 100%; negative predictive value, 59%. Conclusions: These results suggest that MALDI-TOF peptide profiling and neural networks can perform either as a highly sensitive (100% negative predictive value) or a highly specific (100% positive predictive value) diagnostic tool for acute DAT.

Protein-profiling of bacteria using this technique has accelerated the identification of pathogens in diagnostic workflows. Recently, lipid profiling has emerged as a way to complement bacterial identification where protein-based methods fail to provide accurate results. This study aimed to address the challenge of rapid discrimination between Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. using MALDI-TOF MS in the negative ion mode for lipid profiling coupled with machine learning. Both E. coli and Shigella species are closely related; they share high sequence homology, reported for 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between E. coli and Shigella spp. exceeding 99%, and a similar protein expression pattern but are epidemiologically distinct. A bacterial collection of 45 E. coli, 48 Shigella flexneri, and 62 Shigella sonnei clinical isolates were submitted to lipid profiling in negative ion mode using the MALDI Biotyper Sirius (R) system after treatment with mild-acid hydrolysis (acetic acid 1% v/v for 15 min at 98 degrees C). Spectra were then analyzed using our in-house machine learning algorithm and top-ranked features used for the discrimination of the bacterial species. Here, as a proof-of-concept, we showed that lipid profiling might have the potential to differentiate E. coli from Shigella species using the analysis of the top five ranked features obtained by MALDI-TOF MS in the negative ion mode of the MALDI Biotyper Sirius (R) system.

Moreover, in some cnidarian taxa genetic markers are not fully informative, and in these cases combinations of different markers or additional morphological verifications may be required. Proteomic fingerprinting based on MALDI-TOF mass spectra was previously shown to provide reliable species identification in different metazoans including some cnidarian taxa. For the first time, we tested the method across four cnidarian classes (Staurozoa, Scyphozoa, Anthozoa, Hydrozoa) and included different scyphozoan life-history stages (polyp, ephyra, medusa) in our dataset. Our results revealed reliable species identification based on MALDI-TOF mass spectra across all taxa with species-specific clusters for all 23 analysed species. In addition, proteomic fingerprinting was successful for distinguishing developmental stages, still by retaining a species specific signal. Furthermore, we identified the impact of different salinities in different regions (North Sea and Baltic Sea) on proteomic fingerprints to be negligible. In conclusion, the effects of environmental factors and developmental stages on proteomic fingerprints seem to be low in cnidarians.

Although species discrimination can be accomplished on the basis of unique m/z values observed in the MS fingerprint spectrum, discrimination at the strain level is predicted on the relative abundance of shared m/z values among strains within a species. For the 16 mycobacterial strains investigated in the present study, it is possible to unambiguously identify strains within a species on the basis of MALDI-TOF MS data. The error rate for classification of individual strains using linear discriminant analysis was 0.053 using 37 m/z variables, whereas the error rate for classification of individual strains using random forest analysis was 0.023 using only 18 m/z variables.

The MALDI-TOF coupled with the CNN (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 99%, accuracy = 97%) was more efficient than the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and as efficient as qPCR for Wolbachia detection. It therefore represents an interesting method to evaluate the prevalence of Wolbachia in field Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,

In this technical note, we describe a modified thin-layer sample preparation method that significantly reduces the analyte suppression effect (ASE). In our method, analytes are deposited on top of the surface of matrix preloaded on the MALDI plate. To prevent embedding of analyte into the matrix crystals, the sample solution were prepared without matrix and efforts were taken not to re-dissolve the preloaded matrix. The results with model mixtures of peptides, synthetic polymers and lipids show that detection of analyte ions, which were completely suppressed using the conventional dried-droplet method, could be effectively recovered by using our method. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of analytes in the matrix crystals has an important contributory effect on ASE. By reducing ASE, our method should be useful for the direct MALDI MS analysis of multicomponent mixtures.

Recent studies elucidated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra to discriminate methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) or even incorporated with machine learning (ML) techniques. However, no universally applicable mass peaks were revealed, which means that the discrimination model might need to be established or calibrated by local strains' data. Here, a clinically feasible workflow was provided. We collected mass spectra from SAB patients over an 8-month duration and preprocessed by binning with reference peaks. Machine learning models were trained and tested by samples independently of the first six months and the following two months, respectively. The ML models were optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the independent testing of the best model, i.e., SVM, under the optimal parameters were 87%, 75%, 95%, and 87%, respectively. In summary, almost all resistant results were truly resistant, implying that physicians might escalate antibiotics for MRSA 24 h earlier.

This model-based approach provides identification and quantification of proteins through model parameters that are directly interpretable as the number of proteins, mass and abundance of proteins and peak resolution, while having the ability to adapt to unknown smoothness as in wavelet based methods. Informative prior distributions on resolution are key to distinguishing true peaks from background noise and resolving broad peaks into individual peaks for multiple protein species. Posterior distributions are obtained using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and provide inference about the number of peaks (proteins), their masses and abundance. We show through simulation studies that the procedure has desirable true-positive and false-discovery rates.

It is essential to detect the disease quickly and immediately to isolate the infected individuals. Nevertheless, the current widely used PCR and immunoassay-based methods suffer from false negative results and delays in diagnosis. Herein, a high-throughput serum peptidome profiling method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is developed for efficient detection of COVID-19.

After MS data processing and feature selection, eight machine learning methods were used to build classification models. A logistic regression machine learning model with 25 feature peaks achieved the highest accuracy (99%), with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%, for the detection of COVID-19.

Although bacterial resistance appeared before any human life form, this process has accelerated in the past years. Important causes of AR in modern times could be the over-prescription of antibiotics, the presence of faulty infection-prevention strategies, pollution in overcrowded areas, or the use of antibiotics in agriculture and farming, together with a decreased interest from the pharmaceutical industry in researching and testing new antibiotics. The last cause is primarily due to the high costs of developing antibiotics. The aim of the present review is to highlight the techniques that are being developed for the identification of new antibiotics to assist this lengthy process, using artificial intelligence (AI). AI can shorten the preclinical phase by rapidly generating many substances based on algorithms created by machine learning (ML) through techniques such as neural networks (NN) or deep learning (DL). Recently, a text mining system that incorporates DL algorithms was used to help and speed up the data curation process. Moreover, new and old methods are being used to identify new antibiotics, such as the combination of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods with ML or Raman spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS combined with NN, offering faster and easier interpretation of results.

Our aim was to discover new stool protein/peptide biomarkers for diagnosing IBD. Methods: For peptides, MALDI-TOF/MS (m/z 1000 4000) was performed using stools from an exploratory (34 controls; 72 Crohn's disease [CD], 56 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and a validation (28 controls, 27 CD, 15 UC) cohort. For proteins, LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS analysis (6 controls, 5 CD, 5 UC) was performed. Results: MALDI-TOF/MS spectra of IBD patients had numerous features, unlike controls. Overall, 426 features (67 control-associated, 359 IBD-associated) were identified. Spectra were classified as control or IBD (absence or presence of IBD-associated features). In the exploratory cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of this classification algorithm were 81% and 97%, respectively. Blind analysis of the validation cohort confirmed 97% specificity, with a lower sensitivity (55%) paralleling active disease frequency. Following binary logistic regression analysis, IBD was independently correlated with MALDI-TOF/MS spectra (p <0.0001), outperforming fCal measurements (p= 0.029). The IBD-correlated m/z 1810.8 feature was a fragment of APC2, homologous with APC, over-expressed by infiltrating cells lining the surface in UC or the muscularis-mucosae in CD (assessed by immunohistochemistry). IBD-associated over-expressed proteins included immunoglobulins and neutrophil proteins, while those under-expressed comprised proteins of the nucleic acid assembly or those (OLFM4, ENPP7) related to cancer risk. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for the clinical utility of a novel proteomic method for diagnosing IBD and insight on the pathogenic role of APC. Moreover, the newly described IBD-associated proteins might become tools for cancer risk assessment in IBD patients.",English,Green Published,Article,faecal calprotectin; MALDI-TOF; Orbitrap; proteomics; stool

In this study we investigated the question of whether MALDI-TOF MS can be used for accurate sub-differentiation of strains and isolates of two important nosocomial pathogens Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. For this purpose, a selection of 112 pre-characterized E. faecium isolates (clonal complexes CD, CC5, CC9, CC17, CC22, CC25, CC26, CC92 altogether 52 multilocus sequence types) and 59 diverse S. aureus isolates (mostly methicillin resistant; CC5, CC8, CC22, CC30, CC45, CC398) were studied using a combination of MALDI-TOF MS and advanced methods of spectral data analysis. The strategy of MS data evaluation included manual peak inspection on the basis of pseudo gel views, unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis and supervised artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. We were capable of differentiating patterns of hospital-associated E. faecium isolates (CC17) from other strains of E. faecium with 87% accuracy, but failed to identify lineage-specific biomarker peaks. For S. aureus pattern analyses we were able to confirm a number of signals described in previous studies, but often failed to identify biomarkers that would allow a consistent and reliable identification of phylogenetic lineages, clonal complexes or sequence types. Hence, the discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF MS was found to be insufficient for reliably sub-differentiating E. faecium and S. aureus isolates to the level of distinct clones or clonal complexes, such as assessed by MLST. Further, a comparison between peak patterns of susceptible and resistant isolates did not identify statistically relevant marker peaks linked to glycopeptide resistance determinants (vanA, vanB) in E faecium, or the methicillin resistance determinant (mecA) in S. aureus.

In particular, when benchmarked against a MALDI-TOF MS spectral dataset, the new approach improved the identification accuracy of Acinetobacter baumannii from 87.67% to 100%.

Previous studies suggested that migraine was related to immunoglobulin G (IgG). We intended to analyze the immune characteristics of migraine from the perspective of IgG glycosylation and provide theoretical assistance for exploring its pathogenesis. MethodsThe differences in the serum level of IgG glycosylation and glycopeptides between patients with episodic migraine and healthy controls were analyzed by applying the poly(glycerol methacrylate)@chitosan (PGMA@CS) nanomaterial in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). We constructed a binary classification model with a feedforward neural network using PyTorch 1.6.0 in Python 3.8.3 to classify the episodic migraine and healthy control groups. ResultsTwenty patients with migraine and 20 healthy controls were enrolled and the blood samples and clinical information were collected. Forty-nine IgG N-glycopeptides were detected in the serum of the subjects. The serum level of N-glycopeptide IgG1 G0-NF (p = 0.012) was increased in patients with migraine. The serum level of N-glycopeptide IgG3/4 G2FS (p = 0.041) was decreased in patients with migraine with family history of headache. It was found that the serum level of the IgG1 G1 (p = 0.004) and IgG2 G0 (p = 0.045) was increased in patients with migraine with aura, while the serum level of IgG2 G0N (p = 0.043) in patients with migraine with aura was significantly lower than that in patients with migraine without aura. In addition, a linear feedforward neural network (FFNN) was used to construct a binary classification model by detected IgG N-glycopeptides. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the binary classification model, which was constructed with 7 IgG N-glycopeptides, was 0.857, suggesting a good prediction performance. Among these IgG N-glycopeptides that were constructed the model, IgG1 G0-NF was overlapped with the differential IgG N-glycopeptide between patients with migraine and healthy controls detected with MALDI-TOF-MS. ConclusionOur results indicated that the serum level of N-glycopeptides IgG1 G0-NF might be one of the important biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study about the changes of IgG N-glycosylation in patients with migraine by the method of MALDI-TOF-MS.

Our analysis is based on MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry) data from 32 marine copepod species coming from 13 regions (North and Central Atlantic and adjacent seas). A random forest (RF) model correctly classified all specimens to the species level with only small sensitivity to data processing, demonstrating the strong robustness of the method. Compounds with high specificity showed low sensitivity, that is identification was based on complex pattern-differences rather than on presence of single markers. Proteomic distance was not consistently related to phylogenetic distance. A species-gap in proteome composition appeared at 0.7 Euclidean distance when using only specimens from the same sample. When other regions or seasons were included, intraspecific variability increased, resulting in overlaps of intra and inter-specific distance. Highest intraspecific distances (>0.7) were observed between specimens from brackish and marine habitats (i.e., salinity probably affects proteomic patterns). When testing library sensitivity of the RF model to regionality, strong misidentification was only detected between two congener pairs. Still, the choice of reference library may have an impact on identification of closely related species and should be tested before routine application.

This will mostly rely on the annual or daily production of fish eggs. However, these have to be identified precisely to species level to obtain a reliable estimate of offspring production of the different species. Because morphological identification can be very difficult, recent developments are heading towards application of molecular tools. Methods such as COI barcoding have long handling times and cause high costs for single specimen identifications. In order to test MALDI-TOF MS, a rapid and cost-effective alternative for species identification, we identified fish eggs using COI barcoding and used the same specimens to set up a MALDI-TOF MS reference library. This library, constructed from two different MALDI-TOF MS instruments, was then used to identify unknown eggs from a different sampling occasion. By using a line of evidence from hierarchical clustering and different supervised identification approaches we obtained concordant species identifications for 97.5% of the unknown fish eggs, proving MALDI-TOF MS a good tool for rapid species level identification of fish eggs. At the same time we point out the necessity of adjusting identification scores of supervised methods for identification to optimize identification success. Significance: Fish products are commercially highly important and many societies rely on them as a major food resource. Over many decades stocks of various relevant fish species have been reduced due to unregulated overfishing. Nowadays, to avoid overfishing and threatening of important fish species, fish stocks are regularly monitored. One component of this monitoring is the monitoring of spawning stock sizes. Whereas this is highly dependent on correct species identification of fish eggs, morphological identification is difficult because of lack of morphological features.",English,"Green Submitted, Green Published",Article,"Species identification; Fishing quota; Inter laboratory; Random forest;

Therefore, this study aimed to combine population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model and machine learning algorithms to develop a simple and accurate prediction model for TAC. Methods: 139 children with RNS from August 2013 to December 2018 were included, and blood samples of TAC trough and partial peak concentrations were collected. The blood concentration of TAC was determined by enzyme immunoassay; CYP3A5 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method; MYH9, LAMB2, ACTN4 and other genotypes were determined by MALDI-TOF MS method; PPK model was established by nonlinear mixed-effects method. Based on this, six machine learning algorithms, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Extra-Trees, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and Lasso, were used to establish the machine learning model of TAC clearance. Results: A one-compartment model of first-order absorption and elimination adequately described the pharmacokinetics of TAC. Age, co-administration of Wuzhi capsules, CYP3A5 *3/*3 genotype and CTLA4 rs4553808 genotype were significantly affecting the clearance of TAC.

In order to understand the molecular basis of weight, a proteomic approach, employing two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), was used to identify proteins between two kinds of kernels, the high weight kernel (large kernel) and the low weight kernel (small kernels) with different positions within spikes of one wheat cultivar, Shannong. Microscopic observation showed that the endosperm cells in large kernels enlarged their volume and accumulated storage materials at grain filling stage (17 days after anthesis, DAP), whilst those in small kernels were mainly in cell division with larger vacuoles during this period. Proteins were extracted from the kernels at this time, and resolved using 24-cm immobilized PH gradient strips with a pH 3-10 linear gradient in the first dimension and a 12.0% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. About 750 protein spots in each gel were resolved after electrophoresis and 45 proteins were expressed significantly differently between the two kernels. MALDI-TOF MS characterization of the resolved spots in the two samples enabled us to identify 28 proteins whose levels were altered; 19 and 9 proteins were up-regulated in high and low weight kernels, respectively. In particular, proteins beneficial to materials synthesis and transmission increased distinctly in high weight kernels, while in low weight kernels, proteins involved in cell division were increased.

Upon a 5-min incubation in bovine whey from mastitis-affected cows, a significant enrichment of a single peptide characterized by a molecular weight at 4338 Da originated from the proteolysis of a(S1)-casein was observed. Notably, among the large number of macromolecules in bovine milk, the detection of this specific peptide can hardly be accomplished by conventional analytical techniques. The selective formation of a stable binding between the peptide and SAMNs is due to the stability gained by adsorption-induced surface restructuration of the nanomaterial. We attributed the surface recognition properties of SAMNs to the chelation of iron(III) sites on their surface by sterically compatible carboxylic groups of the peptide. The specific peptide recognition by SAMNs allows its easy determination by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and a threshold value of its normalized peak intensity was identified by a logistic regression approach and suggested for the rapid diagnosis of the pathology. Thus, the present report proposes the analysis of hard protein corona on nanomaterials as a perspective for developing fast analytical procedures for the diagnosis of mastitis in cows. Moreover, the huge simplification of proteome complexity by exploiting the selectivity derived by the peculiar SAMN surface topography, due to the iron(III) distribution pattern, could be of general interest, leading to competitive applications in food science and in biomedicine, allowing the rapid determination of hidden biomarkers by a cutting edge diagnostic strategy.",English,,Article,Biomarker; Magnetic nanoparticles; MALDI-TOF; Milk; Protein corona

In this study, we aligned mass spectra generated from endophytes and rhizobacteria isolated from heritage and sweet varieties of Zea mays. Multiple iterations of alignment attempts identified a set of parameters that sorted 114 isolates into 60 coherent MALDI-TOF taxonomic units (MTUs).

Mass spectra were used to train a machine learning algorithm that classified 100% of the isolates into 60 MTUs. These MTUs provided >70% coverage of aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria readily cultured with nutrient rich media from the maize microbiome and allowed prediction of the total diversity recoverable with that particular cultivation method. Acidovorax sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Cellulosimicrobium sp. dominated the library generated from the rhizoplane. Relative to the sweet variety, the heritage variety c ontained a high number of MTUs. The ability to detect these differences in libraries, suggests a rapid and inexpensive method of describing the diversity of bacteria cultured from the endosphere and rhizosphere of maize.",English,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",Article,"MALDI-TOF; PGPR; Rhizosphere; R; Plant microbiome; Machine learning;

The goal of this study was to find biomarkers and establish a serum protein fingerprint model for early diagnosis of ESCC using the ClinProt protocol of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Methods: Serum samples were collected from 62 patients with ESCC, nine patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and 38 healthy individuals. Proteomic spectra of mass to charge ratio (m/z) were generated following the application of plasma to weak cationic-exchanger magnetic beads (WCX-MB). The spectral data were analyzed using a support vector machine, and potential biomarkers were chosen for system training and used to construct diagnostic models. Results: Three differential patterns were established using MALDI-TOF MS. Pattern 1, consisting of 11 protein peaks, separated ESCC patients from the healthy individuals with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 88.4%. Pattern 2, consisting of eight protein peaks, separated ESCC in stage I and stage II from stage III and stage IV with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 82.3%. Pattern 3, consisting of seven protein peaks, separated ESCC from EA with a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 80.0%. Conclusions: These results suggested that MALDI-TOF MS combined with MB separation yields significantly higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of serum protein in patients with ESCC.

However, to achieve a trustworthy identification from MALDI-TOF MS data, a significant amount of biomass should be considered. The bacterial load that potentially occurs in a sample is therefore routinely amplified by culturing, which is a time-consuming procedure. In this paper, we show that culturing can be avoided by conducting MALDI-TOF MS on individual bacterial cells. This results in a more rapid identification of species with an acceptable accuracy. We propose a deep learning architecture to analyze the data and compare its performance with traditional supervised machine learning algorithms.

Especially prior to any preparation the sensory impression is the deciding factor for further processing or any form of consumption. The focus of this study was the sensory evaluation and microbiological characterization by MALDI-TOF of raw chicken meat packaged in two different atmospheres (""CO2(30)"": 30/70% CO2/O-2 and ""CO2(15)"": 15/85% CO2/O-2) over a period of 14 days for CO2(30) and 8 days for CO2(15). The results showed that the composition of the modified atmospheres affects the sensory perception. The chicken meat packaged in CO2(30) was characterized by a sensorial longer shelf life, than the one stored in CO2(15). This could be attributed to the limited inhibition of Pseudomonas sp. in CO2(15). In addition, only a few attributes lead to the waste of meat, while other attributes were found to influence sensory perception only when a critical value of 107 CFU (colony forming units) cm(-2) had already been surpassed. The two attributes general visual impression and general orthonasal impression were suggested as the most suitable indicators of spoilage.

Due to an increasingly clinical need to classify between MRSA and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) efficiently and effectively, we were motivated to develop a systematic pipeline based on a large-scale dataset of MS spectra. However, the shifting problem of peaks in MS spectra induced a low effectiveness in the classification between MRSA and MSSA isolates. Unlike previous works emphasizing on specific peaks, this study employs a binning method to cluster MS shifting ions into several representative peaks. A variety of bin sizes were evaluated to coalesce drifted or shifted MS peaks to a well-defined structured data. Then, various machine learning methods were performed to carry out the classification between MRSA and MSSA samples. Totally 4858 MS spectra of unique S. aureus isolates, including 2500 MRSA and 2358 MSSA instances, were collected by Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals, at Linkou and Kaohsiung branches, Taiwan. Based on the evaluation of Pearson correlation coefficients and the strategy of forward feature selection, a total of 200 peaks (with the bin size of 10 Da) were identified as the marker attributes for the construction of predictive models. These selected peaks, such as bins 2410-2419, 2450-2459 and 6590-6599 Da, have indicated remarkable differences between MRSA and MSSA, which were effective in the prediction of MRSA. The independent testing has revealed that the random forest model can provide a promising prediction with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) at 0.8450. When comparing to previous works conducted with hundreds of MS spectra, the proposed scheme demonstrates that incorporating machine learning method with a large-scale dataset of clinical MS spectra may be a feasible means for clinical physicians on the administration of correct antibiotics in shorter turn-around-time, which could reduce mortality, avoid drug resistance and shorten length of stay in hospital in the future.",English,"hybrid, Green Published",Article,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MRSA; mass spectrometry;

Mass Spectrometry (MS), and more particularly MALDI-TOF, have been widely adopted by routine clinical microbiology laboratories to identify bacterial species and detect AMR. The analysis of AMR with deep learning is still recent, and most models depend on filters and preprocessing techniques manually applied on spectra. Methods This study propose a deep neural network, MSDeepAMR, to learn from raw mass spectra to predict AMR. MSDeepAMR model was implemented for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus under different antibiotic resistance profiles. Additionally, a transfer learning test was performed to study the benefits of adapting the previously trained models to external data. Results MSDeepAMR models showed a good classification performance to detect antibiotic resistance. The AUROC of the model was above 0.83 in most cases studied, improving the results of previous investigations by over 10%. The adapted models improved the AUROC by up to 20% when compared to a model trained only with external data.

By combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we firstly show that the mass spectroscopy data contains strong signal for the clustering of MSSA and MRSA. Then we concentrate on applying supervised learning to extract and verify the important features. A new workflow is proposed that allows for extracting a fixed set of reference peaks so that any new data can be aligned to it and hence consistent feature matrices can be obtained. Also note that by doing so we are able to examine the robustness of the important features that have been found. We also show that appropriate size of the benchmark data, appropriate alignment of the testing data and use of an optimal set of features via feature selection results in prediction accuracy over 90%.

One area where improvements are necessary is in the typing of highly similar samples, such as those samples from the same genus but different species or samples from within a single species but from different strains. One promising way to address this current limitation is by using advanced machine learning techniques. In this work, we adapt a newly developed machine learning tool, the Aristotle Classifier, to bacterial classification of MALDI-TOF MS data. This tool was originally developed for classifying glycomics and glycoproteomics data, so we modified it to be well-suited for assigning mass spectral data from bacterial proteins. The classifier exceeds existing benchmarks in classifying bacteria, and it shows particularly strong performance when the samples to be identified are highly similar. The combination of mass spectrometry data and tools like the Aristotle Classifier could ameliorate the ambiguities associated with challenging bacterial classification problems.",English,Green Accepted,Article,

For this purpose, 27 P. aeruginosa isolates from an outbreak detected in the Hematology department of our hospital were analyzed by the above-mentioned methodologies. Previously, these isolates had been characterized by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Besides, eight P. aeruginosa isolates were analyzed as unrelated controls. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were acquired by transferring several colonies onto the MALDI target and covering them with 1 mu l of formic acid 100% and 1 mu l of a-ciano-3,4-hidroxicinamic acid matrix. For the analysis with FTIR-S, colonies were resuspended in 70% ethanol and sterile water according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spectra from both methodologies were analyzed using Clover Biosoft Software, which allowed data modeling using different algorithms and validation of the classifying models. Three outbreak-specific biomarkers were found at 5,169, 6,915, and 7,236 m/z in MALDI-TOF MS spectra. Classification models based on these three biomarkers showed the same discrimination power displayed by PFGE. Besides, K-nearest neighbor algorithm allowed the discrimination of the same clusters provided by WGS and the validation of this model achieved 97.0% correct classification. On the other hand, FTIR- S showed a discrimination power similar to PFGE and reached correct discrimination of the different STs analyzed.

In blind test analysis the developed MALDI-TOF spectral database permits identification of Schistosoma cercariae with high accuracy (94%) and good specificity (S. bovis: 99.59%, S. haematobium 99.56%, S. mansoni and S. rodhaini: 100%). Most misidentifications were between S. haematobium and the Corsican hybrids. The use of machine learning permits to improve the discrimination between these last two taxa, with accuracy, F1 score and Sensitivity/Specificity > 97%. In multivariate analysis the factors associated with obtaining a valid identification score (> 1.7) were absence of ethanol preservation (p < 0.001) and a number of 2-3 cercariae deposited per well (p < 0.001). Also, spectra acquired from S. mansoni cercariae are more likely to obtain a valid identification score than those acquired from S. haematobium (p<0.001). MALDI-TOF is a reliable technique for high-throughput identification of Schistosoma cercariae of medical and veterinary importance and could be useful for field survey in endemic areas. Author summarySchistosomiases are neglected tropical diseases, affecting approximately 200 million people worldwide. They are transmitted during contact with water contaminated with the infesting stage of the parasite (the cercaria stage). Species-level recognition of cercariae present in water has important implications for field campaigns aimed at eradicating schistosomiasis. In addition, Schistosomes are able to hybridize between different species. Identification of Schistosomes cercariae on microscopy is difficult because of their similarity, and it does not allow hybrids to be distinguished. Molecular biology techniques allow a reliable diagnosis but are expensive. MALDI-TOF is a recent technique that permits an inexpensive identification of micro-organisms in a few minutes. In this paper, we evaluate MALDI-TOF identification of Schistosomes cercariae.We have implemented a database of MALDI-TOF cercariae spectra obtained from parental strains and hybrids of species of medical or veterinary interest, allowing reliable identification with an accuracy of 94%. The identification errors mainly come from confusion between the natural Corsican hybrid (S. haematobium x S. bovis) and S. haematobium. The use of machine learning algorithms permits to obtain an accuracy of more than 97% in the recognition of these two parasites. In conclusion, MALDI-TOF is a promising tool for the identification of Schistosome cercariae.",English,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",Article,

Animals have to be examined for minor differences of setae compositions, mouthpart morphology or number of segments for various extremities. DNA-based methods such as metabarcoding as well as recently emerged rapid analyses using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify specimens based on a proteome fingerprint could vastly accelerate the process of specimen identification in biodiversity assessments. However, these techniques depend on reference libraries to connect collected data to morphologically described species. In this study the success rate of both approaches have been tested based on reference libraries constructed using part of the samples from a new study area to identify unknown samples. Using MALDI-TOF MS we found, that species which do not exist in an incomplete mass spectra reference library only have minor impact on the results, when employing a post hoc test for Random Forest classifications. This test reveals specimens that demand morphological re-examination for the final species assignment. Metabarcoding however strongly demands a rich reference library to provide correct MOTU assessments in congruence with morphological determination. Nevertheless, with a complete library and a suitable data transformation [herein log(x + 1)], the number of reads per MOTU reflects relative species abundances in metabarcoding inference. The results of this study facilitate specimen identification by using MALDI-TOF MS, which is incomparably cheap for specimen-by-specimen identification, but when it comes to sample-wise analyses, metabarcoding outperforms other techniques by far.",English,"gold, Green Accepted",Article,"meiofauna; proteomic fingerprint; species identification; COI;

Currently, Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry is extensively used to identify microbial isolates at the species level. Since most of clinical laboratories are equipped with this technology, there is a question of whether this equipment can sort a particular clone from a population of various isolates of the same species. We performed an experiment in which 19 clonal isolates of Aspergillus flavus initially collected on contaminated surgical masks were included in a set of 55 A. flavus isolates of various origins. A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect the isolates belonging to the clone. In this experiment, the training and testing sets were totally independent, and different MALDI-TOF devices (Microflex) were used for the training and testing phases. The CNN was used to correctly sort a large portion of the isolates, with excellent (> 93%) accuracy for two of the three devices used and with less accuracy for the third device (69%), which was older and needed to have the laser replaced.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,

This study meticulously examined clinical, microbiological, and molecular aspects related to in-hospital mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) bloodstream infections (BSIs). From 292 isolates, 153 cases were scrutinized, reidentified through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), and evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility and carbapenemase genes via multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Utilizing supervised machine learning, the study constructed models to predict 14- and 30-day mortality rates, revealing the Na & iuml;ve Bayes model's superior specificity (0.75) and area under the curve (0.822) for 14-day mortality, and the Random Forest model's impressive recall (0.85) for 30-day mortality. These models delineated eight and nine significant features for 14- and 30-day mortality predictions, respectively, with ""septic shock"" as a pivotal variable. Additional variables such as neutropenia with neutropenic days prior to sepsis, mechanical ventilator support, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure were also identified as ranking features. However, empirical antibiotic therapy appropriateness and specific microbiological data had minimal predictive efficacy. This research offers foundational data for assessing mortality risks associated with CRAB BSI and underscores the importance of stringent infection control practices in the wake of the scarcity of new effective antibiotics against resistant strains. The advanced models and insights generated in this study serve as significant resources for managing the repercussions of A. baumannii infections, contributing substantially to the clinical understanding and management of such infections in healthcare environments.",English,,Article,"Acinetobacter baumannii; machine learning; bloodstream infection;

Reliable, noninvasive methods for early detection of liver cirrhosis are not availabe. Using a three-step approach, we classified sera from rats with liver cirrhosis following different treatment insults. The approach consisted of: (i) protein profiling using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) technology; (ii) selection of a statistically significant serum biomarker set using machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identification of selected serum biomarkers by peptide sequencing. We generated serum protein profiles from three groups of rats: (i) normal (n = 8), (ii) thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis (n = 22), and (iii) bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis (n = 5) using a weak cation exchanger surface. Profiling data were further analyzed by a recursive support vector machine algorithm to select a panel of statistically significant biomarkers for class prediction. Sensitivity and specificity of classification using the selected protein marker set were higher than 92%. A consistently down-regulated 3495 Da protein in cirrhosis samples was one of the selected significant biomarkers. This 3495 Da protein was purified on-chip and trypsin digested. Further structural characterization of this biomarkers candidate was done by using cross-platform matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Combined data from PMF and MS/MS spectra of two tryptic peptides suggested that this 3495 Da protein shared homology to a histidine-rich glycoprotein. These results demonstrated a novel approach to discovery of new biomarkers for early detection of liver cirrhosis classification of liver diseases.",English,,Article,cirrhosis; recursive support vector machine; SELDI/MALDI-MS/MS

The analysis can be done for a set of spectra with use of the mean spectrum, or it may be performed for a single spectrum at a time. The number of mixture-model components is estimated by the Bayesian information criterion. Before the main analysis, a few pre-processing steps need to be done.

First, raw spectral data are processed using QceAlign, which exploits Bayesian and maximum entropy methods for peak identification and calibration. The raw spectral data are baseline corrected and normalized. Peak identification is based on a Bayesian second derivative of the baseline-corrected and normalized raw data, with peak S/N statistics provided by a maximum entropy smoothing function. A reference MALDI-TOF reference spectrum is created from the data and each spectrum is slid by n data points to the right or left along the x axis of the reference file. At each relative position n, the Shannon entropy of the sum of the two files is computed. Optimal alignment is associated with the shift that produces the minimum Shannon entropy. Second, a genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern recognition analysis is applied to the peak matched data. The pattern recognition GA selects features that optimize the separation of the sample classes in a plot of the two or three largest principal components of the data. Because the largest principal components capture the bulk of the variance in the data, the spectral features chosen by the pattern recognition GA convey information primarily about the differences between classes in the data. In addition, the algorithm focuses on those classes and or samples that are difficult to classify as it trains by boosting the sample and class weights. Samples that consistently classify correctly are not as heavily weighted as those samples that are difficult to classify. The pattern recognition GA integrates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a ""smart"" one-pass procedure for features selection, classification, and prediction in a single step.

A delay in targeted antibiotic treatment contributes to longer hospitalization stay, higher costs, and increasing in-hospital mortality. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been integrated into the routine workflow for microbial identification over the past decade, and it has also shown promising functions in the detection of bacterial resistance. Therefore, we describe a rapid MALDI-TOF MS-based methodology for MRSA screening with machine-learning algorithms. Methods A total of 452 clinical S. aureus isolates were included in this study, of which 194 were MRSA and 258 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). The mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) features from MRSA and MSSA strains were binned and selected through Lasso regression. These features were then used to train a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernels to evaluate the discrimination performance. The classifiers' accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were evaluated and compared with those from the random forest (RF) model. Results A total of 2601 unique spectral peaks of all isolates were identified and 38 m/z features were selected for the classifying model. The AUCs of the non-linear RBF-SVM model and the RF model were 0.89 and 0.87, respectively, and the accuracy ranged between 0.86 (RBF-SVM) and 0.82 (RF). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS coupled with machine-learning algorithms could be used to develop a rapid and easy-to-use method to discriminate MRSA from MSSA. Considering that this method is easy to implement in routine microbiology laboratories, it suggests a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to conventional resistance detection in the future to improve clinical treatment.",English,,Article,

We report here a combined approach of machine learning (ML) and microchip-based MALDI-time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry to investigate the cytotoxic effect of herbicides on algae through single cell lipid profiling. Algal species Selenastrum capricornutum was chosen as the target system, and its exposure to different doses of common chemical herbicides and the resulting cytotoxic behaviors under various stress conditions were characterized. A lipid library for S. capricornutum has been established with 63 identified lipids that indude glycosyldiacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. We demonstrated that major alternations occurred for lipids with functional groups of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), triacylglycerol (TAG), and monogalactosyldiacylgjycerol (MGDG). DGDG was shown to decrease upon exposure to herbicides of norflurazon and atrazine, while some MGDG and TAG lipids would increase for norflurazon. Compared to other algae, S. capricornutum was more strongly impacted by norflurazon than atrazine while the latter was observed to have a greater effect on C reinhardtii. Machine learning algorithms have been applied to improve the classification of herbicide impact and help identify lipid species affected by the chemical exposure. A total of 69 machine learning models were trained and tested for the identification of ideal algorithms in the classification process, in which flexible discriminant analysis and support vector machine model were found to be the most accurate and consistent. The ML algorithms accurately differentiated herbicide impact and have identified cytotoxic differences that were previously hidden. The results suggest that herbicides express toxicity among different algae likely on the basis of metabolic differences. The ML-assisted method proves to be highly effective and can provide an advanced technological platform for probing cytotoxicity for bacterial species and in metabolic pathway analysis.",English,,Article,

This study investigates a machine learning algorithm based on protein levels in the blood that can be used to help with diagnosis. The test shows promising results, especially in patients with smaller tumors and compared to current blood detection tests. This research suggests an important role in the future for machine learning algorithm-based blood detection tests. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest growing causes of cancer-related death. Guidelines recommend obtaining a screening ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months in at-risk adults. AFP as a screening biomarker is plagued by low sensitivity/specificity, prompting interest in discovering alternatives. Mass spectrometry-based techniques are promising in their ability to identify potential biomarkers. This study aimed to use machine learning utilizing spectral data and AFP to create a model for early detection. Serum samples were collected from three separate cohorts, and data were compiled to make Development, Internal Validation, and Independent Validation sets. AFP levels were measured, and Deep MALDI analysis was used to generate mass spectra. Spectral data were input into the VeriStrat classification algorithm. Machine learning techniques then classified each sample as ""Cancer"" or ""No Cancer"". Sensitivity and specificity of the test were >80% to detect HCC. High specificity of the test was independent of cause and severity of underlying disease. When compared to AFP, there was improved cancer detection for all tumor sizes, especially small lesions. Overall, a machine learning algorithm incorporating mass spectral data and AFP values from serum samples offers a novel approach to diagnose HCC.

Rapid and accurate identification of Yersinia strains is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and timely intervention for infection control. In the past decade matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with computer-aided pattern recognition has evolved as a rapid, objective, and reliable technique for microbial identification. In this comprehensive study a total of 146 strains of all currently known Yersinia species complemented by 35 strains of other relevant genera of the Enterobacteriaceae family were investigated by MALDI-TOF MS and chemometrics. Bacterial sample preparation included microbial inactivation according to a recently developed mass spectrometry compatible inactivation protocol. The mass spectral profiles were evaluated by supervised feature selection methods to identify family-, genus-, and species-specific biomarker proteins and for classification purposes by pattern recognition techniques. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a high degree of correlation between bacterial taxonomy and subproteome-based MALDI-TOF MS classification. Furthermore, classification analysis by supervised artificial neural networks allowed identification of strains of Y. pestis with an accuracy of 100%.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), a proven technique in the field of protein and peptide identification and quantification, may be a valuable alternative approach for the rapid assessment of microbial spoilage. In this work we therefore developed MALDI-TOF-MS as a novel analytical approach for the assessment of food that when combined with chemometrics allows for the detection and quantification of milk and pork meat spoilage bacteria. To develop this approach, natural spoilage of pasteurized milk and raw pork meat samples incubated at 15 degrees C and at room temperature, respectively, was conducted. Samples were collected for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (which took 4 min per sample) at regular time intervals throughout the spoilage process, with concurrent calculation and documentation of reference total viable counts using traditional microbiological methods (these took 2 days). Multivariate statistical techniques such as principal, component discriminant function analysis, canonical correlation analysis, partial least squares (PLS) regression, and kernel PLS (KPLS) were used to analyze the data The results from MALDI-TOF-MS combined with PLS or ICPLS gave excellent bacterial quantification results for both milk and meat spoilage, and typical root mean squared errors for prediction in test spectra were between 0.53 and 0.79 log unit Overall these novel findings strongly indicate that MALDI-TOF-MS when combined with chemometric approaches would be a useful adjunct for routine use in the milk and meat industry as a fast and accurate viable bacterial detection and quantification method.",English,,Article,

Waiting for the collective immunity by vaccination, mass-testing, and isolation of positive cases remain essential. The development of a diagnosis method requiring a simple and non-invasive sampling with a quick and low-cost approach is on demand. We hypothesized that the combination of saliva specimens with MALDI-TOF MS profiling analyses could be the winning duo. Before characterizing MS saliva signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, optimization and standardization of sample collection, preparation and storage up to MS analyses appeared compulsory. In this view, successive experiments were performed on saliva from healthy healthcare workers. Specimen sampling with a roll cotton of Salivette (R) devices appeared the most appropriate collection mode. Saliva protein precipitation with organic buffers did not improved MS spectra profiles compared to a direct loading of samples mixed with acetonitrile/formic acid buffer onto MS plate. The assessment of sample storage conditions and duration revealed that saliva should be stored on ice until MS analysis, which should occur on the day of sampling. Kinetic collection of saliva highlighted reproducibility of saliva MS profiles over four successive days and also at two-week intervals. The intra-individual stability of saliva MS profiles should be a key factor in the future investigation for biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the singularity of MS profiles between individuals will require the development of sophisticated bio-statistical analyses such as machine learning approaches. MALDI-TOF MS profiling of saliva could be a promising PCR-free tool for SARS-CoV-2 screening.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis; saliva; MS profiling; standardization

These bacteria also have a great capacity to spread the resistance genes, sometimes to phylogenetically distant bacteria, which poses an additional threat to public health worldwide. Here, we aimed to use the analytical potential of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize E. coli isolates and identify proteins associated closely with antibiotic resistance. Thirty strains of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli were sampled from various animals. The phenotypes of antibiotic resistance were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methods, and they showed that all bacterial isolates were multi-resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and ampicillin. To identify peptides characteristic of resistance to particular antibiotics, each strain was grown in the presence or absence of the different antibiotics, and then proteins were extracted from the cells. The protein fingerprints of the samples were determined by MALDI-TOF MS in linear mode over a mass range of 2 to 20 kDa. The spectra obtained were compared by using the ClinProTools bioinformatics software, using three machine learning classification algorithms.

Many biological, chemical, and physical indicators can be used to determine the postmortem interval, but most are not accurate. Here, we present a novel matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method that can be used for the estimation of PMI using molecular images and multivariate analyses. In this study, we demonstrate that both rat and human liver tissues of various PMIs (0, 2, 4, and 6days) can be discriminated using MALDI imaging and principal component analysis (PCA). Using genetic algorithm (GA), supervised neural network (SNN), and quick classifier (QC) methods, we built 6 classification models, which showed high recognition capability and good cross-validation. The histological changes in all the samples at different time points were also consistent with the changes seen in MALDI imaging.

Searching for diagnostic and prognostic methods that are fast, low-cost and accurate are essential for disease control and patient recovery. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technique is rapid, low cost and accurate when compared to other MS methods, thus its use is already reported in the literature for various applications, including microorganism identification, diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Methods Here we developed a prognostic method for COVID-19 using the proteomic profile of saliva samples submitted to MALDI-TOF and machine learning algorithms to train models for COVID-19 severity assessment. Results We achieved an accuracy of 88.5%, specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 91.5% for classification between mild/moderate and severe conditions. When we tested the model performance in an independent dataset, we achieved an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 67.18, 52.17 and 75.60% respectively. Conclusion Saliva is already reported to have high inter-sample variation; however, our results demonstrates that this approach has the potential to be a prognostic method for COVID-19. Additionally, the technology used is already available in several clinics, facilitating the implementation of the method.

However, correct identification by MALDI-TOF of closely related microorganisms such as viridans streptococci is still cumbersome, especially in the identification of S. pneumoniae. By making use of additional spectra peaks for S. pneumoniae and other viridans group streptococci (VGS). We re-identified viridans streptococci that had been identified and characterized by molecular and phenotypic techniques by MALDI-TOF. Methods: VGS isolates (n = 579), 496 S. pneumoniae and 83 non-S. pneumoniae were analysed using MALDI-TOF MS and the sensitivity and specificity of MALDI-TOF MS was assessed. Hereafter, mass spectra analysis was performed. Presumptive identification of proteins represented by discriminatory peaks was performed by molecular weight matching and the corresponding nucleotides sequences against different protein databases. Results: Using the Bruker reference library, 495 of 496 S. pneumoniae isolates were identified as S. pneumoniae and one isolate was identified as non-S. pneumoniae. Of the 83 non-S. pneumoniae isolates, 37 were correctly identified as non-S. pneumoniae, and 46 isolates as S. pneumoniae. The sensitivity of the MALDI-TOF MS was 99.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 98.9-100) and the specificity was 44.6% (95% CI 33.7-55.9). Eight spectra peaks were mostly present in one category (S. pneumoniae or other VGS) and absent in the other category and inversely. Two spectra peaks of these (m/z 3420 and 3436) were selected by logistic regression to generate three identification profiles. These profiles could differentiate between S. pneumoniae and other VGS with high sensitivity and specificity (99.4% and 98.8%, respectively). Conclusions: Spectral peaks analysis based identification is a powerful tool to differentiate S. pneumoniae from other VGS species with high specificity and sensitivity and is a useful method for pneumococcal identification in carriage studies. More research is needed to further confirm our findings. Extrapolation of these results to clinical strains need to be deeply investigated.

In this study, we aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm-based rapid susceptibility method to distinguish vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEfm) strains. A predictive model was developed and validated to distinguish VREfm and VSEfm strains by analyzing the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) spectra of unique E. faecium isolates from different specimen types. The algorithm used 5,717 mass spectra, including 2,795 VREfm and 2,922 VSEfm mass spectra, and was externally validated with 2,280 mass spectra of isolates (1,222 VREfm and 1,058 VSEfm strains). A random forest-based algorithm demonstrated overall good classification performances for the isolates from the specimens, with mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.78, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively, with 10-fold cross-validation, time-wise validation, and external validation. Furthermore, the algorithm provided rapid results, which would allow susceptibility prediction prior to the availability of phenotypic susceptibility results. In conclusion, an ML algorithm designed using mass spectra obtained from the routine workflow may be able to rapidly differentiate VREfm strains from VSEfm strains; however, susceptibility results must be confirmed by routine methods, given the demonstrated performance of the assay. IMPORTANCE A modified binning method was incorporated to cluster MS shifting ions into a set of representative peaks based on a large-scale MS data set of clinical VREfm and VSEfm isolates, including 2,795 VREfm and 2,922 VSEfm isolates. Predictions with the algorithm were significantly more accurate than empirical antibiotic use, the accuracy of which was 0.50, based on the local epidemiology. The algorithm improved the accuracy of antibiotic administration, compared to empirical antibiotic prescription. An ML algorithm designed using MALDI-TOF MS spectra obtained from the routine workflow accurately differentiated VREfm strains from VSEfm strains, especially in blood and sterile body fluid samples, and can be applied to facilitate the rapid and accurate clinical testing of pathogens.",English,Green Published,Article,"vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium; antibacterial drug

Even with resection, the cure rate is extremely low due to local recurrence and metastatic disease. Early detection and effective therapeutic intervention are essential to improve survival. Aims This study tested the hypothesis that the presence of EC modulates concentrations of specific plasma proteins and peptides, potentially allowing discrimination between EC and controls based on mass spectrometric analysis of the respective plasma proteomes. Methods Blood samples from 79 esophageal cancer patients and 40 age-matched normal subjects were processed to plasma, and protein/peptide sub-fractions were isolated using HIC8 or WAX-derivatized superparamagnetic beads. Triplicate matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectra were acquired for specific plasma fractions from each subject. Results HIC8 and WAX-derivatized plasma eluates yielded 79 and 77 candidate features, respectively, and a Random Forest algorithm identified a subset of features whose peak intensities allowed discrimination between cancer patients and controls. Areas under the curve in receiver operating characteristic curves for HIC8 spectra were 0.88 and 0.83 for WAX spectra. The combined feature set discriminated EC from control plasma with 79 % sensitivity and 79 % specificity, with positive and negative test likelihood ratios of >14 and 0.17, respectively. Conclusions These data lay the foundation for the development of a clinically useful test for esophageal cancer based on statistical analysis of proteomic spectra of patient plasma samples.

We propose a new procedure of biomarker discovery in serum protein profiles based on: (i) discrete wavelet transformation of the spectra; (ii) selection of discriminative wavelet coefficients by a statistical test and (iii) building and evaluating a support vector machine classifier by double cross-validation with attention to the generalizability of the results. In addition to the evaluation results (total recognition rate, sensitivity and specificity), the procedure provides the biomarker patterns, i. e. the parts of spectra which discriminate cancer and control individuals. The evaluation was performed on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) serum protein profiles of 66 colorectal cancer patients and 50 controls. Results: Our procedure provided a high recognition rate (97.3%), sensitivity (98.4%) and specificity (95.8%). The extracted biomarker patterns mostly represent the peaks expressing mean differences between the cancer and control spectra. However, we showed that the discriminative power of a peak is not simply expressed by its mean height and cannot be derived by comparison of the mean spectra. The obtained classifiers have high generalization power as measured by the number of support vectors.

Multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia are monoclonal gammopathies with unclear etiology, caused by malignant transformation of bone marrow plasma cells. Mass spectrometry with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight detection is commonly used for investigation of the peptidome and small proteome of blood plasma with high accuracy, robustness, and cost-effectivity. In addition, mass spectrometry coupled with advanced statistics can be used for molecular profiling, classification, and diagnosis of liquid biopsies and tissue specimens in various malignancies. Despite the fact there have been fully optimized protocols for mass spectrometry of normal blood plasma available for decades, in monoclonal gammopathy patients, the massive alterations of biophysical and biochemical parameters of peripheral blood plasma often limit the mass spectrometry measurements. In this paper, we present a new two-step extraction protocol and demonstrated the enhanced resolution and intensity (>50x) of mass spectra obtained from extracts of peripheral blood plasma from monoclonal gammopathy patients. When coupled with advanced statistics and machine learning, the mass spectra profiles enabled the direct identification, classification, and discrimination of multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia patients with high accuracy and precision. A model based on PLS-DA achieved the best performance with 71.5% accuracy (95% confidence interval, CI = 57.1-83.3%) when the 10x repeated 5-fold CV was performed.

In the June, 2012 issue, Ishigami et al. used principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features and support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate and classify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from two small cohorts of patients diagnosed with either Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) based on differences in the patterns of peaks generated with matrix-assisted desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). PCA accurately segregated patients with PD and MSA from controls when the cohorts were combined, but did not perform well when segregating PD from MSA. On the other hand, SVM, a machine learning classification model, correctly classified the samples from patients with early PD or MSA, and the peak at m/z 6250 was identified as a strong contributor to the ability of SVM to distinguish the proteomic profiles of either cohort when trained on one cohort.

The ability of the CarbaNP assay to detect IS-mediated activation of the cfiA gene was assessed and the results obtained by molecular analysis were used as reference methods. Results The support vector machine model generated by ClinProTools was found to be the most reliable algorithm for differentiation of cfiA-positive and cfiA-negative B. fragilis subgroups. Using the direct transfer method, all but one cfiA-negative isolates were correctly identified to the two subgroups by the model. The correct identification of the cfiA-negative isolate was obtained upon retesting by the extraction method. Of the 81 cfiA-positive isolates, PCR and sequencing showed that 30 had an IS element providing the promoter for activation of cfiA.

The Euclidean distance method is used to measure the similarity between Radix bupleuri samples, and the quality control chart method is applied to quantitatively describe their quality fluctuation. Results It is found that the samples from the same origin are relatively similar and mainly fluctuate within the control limit, but the fluctuation range is large, and it is impossible to distinguish the samples from different origins. The SVM algorithm can effectively eliminate the impact of intensity fluctuations and huge data dimensions by combining the normalization of MALDI-TOF MS data and the dimensionality reduction of principal components, and finally achieve efficient identification of the origin of Radix bupleuri, with an average recognition rate of 98.5%.

Serum peptide profiling of NSCLC patients was performed to investigate patterns associated with treatment outcome. Using magnetic bead-assisted serum peptide capture coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), serum peptide mass profiles of 27 NSCLC patients treated with cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy and bortezomib were obtained. Support vector machine-based algorithms to predict clinical outcome were established based on differential pre-treatment peptide profiles and dynamic changes in peptide abundance during treatment. Results: A 6-peptide ion signature distinguished with 82% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity patients with a relatively short vs. long progression-free survival (PFS) upon treatment. Prediction of long PFS was associated with longer overall survival. Inclusion of 7 peptide ions showing differential changes in abundance during treatment led to a 13-peptide ion signature with 86% accuracy at 100% sensitivity and 73% specificity. A 5-peptide ion signature could separate patients with a partial response vs. non-responders with 89% accuracy at 100% sensitivity and 83% specificity.

Therefore, biomarkers corresponding to each stage may exist. To deal with such a multi-category problem, including sample stage prediction and biomarker selection, we propose methods for classification and feature selection. The proposed classification method is based on two schemes: error-correcting output coding (ECOC) and pairwise coupling (PWC). The final decision for a test sample prediction is an integration of these two schemes. The biomarker pattern for distinguishing each disease category from another one is achieved by the development of an extended Markov blanket (EMB) feature selection method. Results: In this study, a liver cancer matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) dataset was used, which comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and healthy spectra.

A collection of 82 well-characterized MRSA isolates belonging to the four main CCs (CC5, CC8, CC22 and CC398) was split into a reference set (n = 36) and a validation set (n = 46) to generate pattern recognition models using the CLINPROTOOLS software for the identification of MALDI-TOF/MS biomarker peaks. The supervised neural network (SNN) model showed the best performance compared with two other models, with sensitivity and specificity values of 100% and 99.11%, respectively. Eleven peaks (m/z range: 3278-6592) with the highest separation power were identified and used to differentiate all four CCs. Validation of the SNN model using CLINPROTOOLS resulted in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 99.6%. The specific contribution of each peak to the model was used to generate subtyping reference signatures for automated subtyping using the BIOTYPER software, which successfully classified MRSA isolates into their corresponding CCs with a PPV of 98.9%. In conclusion, we find this novel automated MALDI-TOF/MS approach to be a promising, powerful and reliable tool for S. aureus typing.

Conventional work flows are time-consuming, and procedures are multifaceted. MS can be an alternative but is limited by low efficiency for amino acid sequencing as well as low reproducibility for spectrum fingerprinting. We systematically analyzed the feasibility of applying MS for rapid and accurate bacterial identification. Directly applying bacterial colonies without further protein extraction to MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed rich peak contents and high reproducibility. The MS spectra derived from 57 isolates comprising six human pathogenic bacterial species were analyzed using both unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised model construction via the Genetic Algorithm. Hierarchical clustering analysis categorized the spectra into six groups precisely corresponding to the six bacterial species. Precise classification was also maintained in an independently prepared set of bacteria even when the numbers of m/z values were reduced to six. In parallel, classification models were constructed via Genetic Algorithm analysis. A model containing 18 m/z values accurately classified independently prepared bacteria and identified those species originally not used for model construction. Moreover bacteria fewer than 10(4) cells and different species in bacterial mixtures were identified using the classification model approach. In conclusion, the application of MALDI-TOF MS in combination with a suitable model construction provides a highly accurate method for bacterial classification and identification. The approach can identify bacteria with low abundance even in mixed flora, suggesting that a rapid and accurate bacterial identification using MS techniques even before culture can be attained in the near future.",English,,Article,

Using Spectral Clustering, four subgroups of individuals were identified within the study population. These subgroups were delimited by the pattern of variation in 9 peaks detected in the 2-15 kDa m/z range. An Unsupervised Feature Selection algorithm showed that P-C peptide, a 44 residue-long salivary acidic proline-rich protein, and three of its fragments (Fr. 1-25, Fr. 15-35 and Fr. 15-44) play a central role in delimiting the subgroups. Significant differences were found in the salivary biochemistry of the subgroups with regard to lysozyme and chitinase, two enzymes that are part of the salivary innate defense system (p < 0.001).

We applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to a collection of B. anthracis strains and close relatives in order to significantly improve the statistical confidence of identification results for this group of bacteria. Protein mass spectra of 189 verified and diverse Bacillus strains of the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group were generated using MALDI-TOF MS and subsequently analyzed with supervised and unsupervised statistical methods, such as shrinkage discriminant analysis (SDA) and principal-component analysis (PCA). We aimed at identifying specific biomarkers in the protein spectra of B. anthracis not present in closely related Bacillus species.

Main spectra (MSP) of a defined collection of Bacillus strains were compiled using the Bruker Biotyper software and added to an in-house reference library. Reevaluation of this library with 15 hitherto untested strains of B. anthracis and B. cereus yielded improved score values. The B. anthracis strains were identified with score values between 2.33 and 2.55 using the in-house database, while the same strains were identified with scores between 1.94 and 2.37 using the commercial database, and no false-positive identifications occurred using the in-house database.",English,"Green Published, Bronze",Article,"Bacillus anthracis; Bacillus cereus; biotyping; MALDI-TOF; mass

We demonstrate that the combination of supervised machine learning and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry can discriminate strains of S. uberis causing clinical mastitis that are likely to be responsive or unresponsive to treatment. Diagnostics prediction systems trained on 90 individuals from 26 different farms achieved up to 86.2% and 71.5% in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa. The performance was further increased by adding metadata (parity, somatic cell count of previous lactation and count of positive mastitis cases) to encoded MALDI-TOF spectra, which increased accuracy and Cohen's kappa to 92.2% and 84.1% respectively.

However, an extremely high level of similarity between VGS within the mitis group (S.pneumoniae, S.mitis, S.oralis and S.pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. Earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been suggested as a tool for the rapid identification of S.pneumoniae. However, by using Biotyper 3.0 (Bruker) or Vitek MS (bioMerieux) databases, Streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as S.pneumoniae. ClinProTools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of MALDI-TOF mass spectra of 25 S.pneumoniae isolates, 34 S.mitis and three S.oralis. Phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the S.pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. The classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Supervised Neural Network and QuickClassifier). In all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. Three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built.

Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry was used to identify S. uberis isolates potentially capable of contagious transmission. Data were available from 10,652 cows from 52 English and Welsh dairy farms over a 14 month period, and 521 isolates of S. uberis from clinical mastitis cases were available for analysis. As well as the temporal herd history of clinical mastitis associated with particular S. uberis strains, other exposure variables included cow parity, stage of lactation, milk yield, and somatic cell count. Observations were structured longitudinally as repeated weekly measures through the study period for each cow. Data were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using multilevel logistic regression models. Similarity of mass spectral profiles between isolates of S. uberis from consecutive clinical cases of mastitis in herds was used to indicate potential for contagious phenotypic characteristics. Cross validation showed that new isolates with these characteristics could be identified with an accuracy of 90% based on bacterial protein mass spectral characteristics alone. The cow-level risk in any week of these S. uberis clinical mastitis cases increased with the presence of the same specific strains of S. uberis in other cows in the herd during the previous 2 weeks. The final statistical model indicated there would be a 2-3 fold increase in the risk of S. uberis clinical mastitis associated with particular strains if these occurred in the herd 1 and 2 weeks previously. The results suggest that specific strains of S. uberis may be involved with contagious transmission, and predictions based on their occurrence could be used as an early warning surveillance system to enhance the control of S. uberis mastitis.

These MS based approaches have the potential to be both rapid and sensitive and can be done on-site without requiring a dedicated laboratory or depending on constrained supply chains (i.e., reagents and consumables). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF) MS has a long and established history of microorganism detection and systemic disease assessment. Previously, we have shown that automated machine learning (ML) enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS screening of nasal swabs can be both sensitive and specific for COVID-19 detection. The underlying molecules responsible for this detection are generally unknown nor are they required for this automated ML platform to detect COVID-19. However, the identification of these molecules is important for understanding both the mechanism of detection and potentially the biology of the underlying infection. Here, we used nanoscale liquid chromatography tandem MS to identify endogenous peptides found in nasal swab saline transport media to identify peptides in the same the mass over charge (m/z) values observed by the MALDI-TOF-MS method. With our peptidomics workflow, we demonstrate that we can identify endogenous peptides and endogenous protease cut sites. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 viral peptides were not readily detected and are highly unlikely to be responsible for the accuracy of MALDI based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

The development of fast, affordable and effective diagnostic solutions capable of discriminating between antibiotic-resistant and susceptible S. aureus strains would be of huge benefit for effective disease detection and treatment. Here we develop a diagnostics solution that uses Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and machine learning, to identify signature profiles of antibiotic resistance to either multidrug or benzylpenicillin in S. aureus isolates. Using ten different supervised learning techniques, we have analysed a set of 82 S. aureus isolates collected from 67 cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis across 24 farms. For the multidrug phenotyping analysis, LDA, linear SVM, RBF SVM, logistic regression, naive Bayes, MLP neural network and QDA had Cohen's kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin phenotyping analysis, RBF SVM, MLP neural network, naive Bayes, logistic regression, linear SVM, QDA, LDA, and random forests had Cohen's kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin the diagnostic systems achieved up to (mean result standard deviation over 30 runs on the test set): accuracy = 97.54% +/- 1.91%, sensitivity = 99.93% +/- 0.25%, specificity = 95.04% +/- 3.83%, and Cohen's kappa = 95.04% +/- 3.83%. Moreover, the diagnostic platform complemented by a protein-protein network and 3D structural protein information framework allowed the identification of five molecular determinants underlying the susceptible and resistant profiles. Four proteins were able to classify multidrug-resistant and susceptible strains with 96.81% +/- 0.43% accuracy. Five proteins, including the previous four, were able to classify benzylpenicillin resistant and susceptible strains with 97.54% +/- 1.91% accuracy.

Author summary Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to human and animal health. The incessant emergence of new multidrug-resistant bacteria needs to be counterbalanced by the implementation of effective diagnostics solutions to detect resistance and support treatment selection. The objective of this study is the development of effective diagnostic solutions to identify resistance to benzylpenicillin and other drugs in S. aureus strains infecting dairy cattle. S. aureus is one of the most common pathogens of clinical mastitis in the dairy industry, affecting productivity, profitability, animal health and welfare, and has an extraordinary capacity for acquiring new antibiotic resistance traits. Our diagnostic solution combines machine learning and mass spectrometry.

Material/Methods Participants received twelve extended spectrum betalactamase-producing E. coli isolates and followed the same standard operating procedure (SOP) including a full-protein extraction protocol. All laboratories provided visually read spectra via flexAnalysis (Bruker, Germany). Raw data from each laboratory allowed calculating the technical and biological reproducibility between centers using BioNumerics (Applied Maths NV, Belgium). Results Technical and biological reproducibility ranged between 96.8 +/- 99.4% and 47.6 +/- 94.4%, respectively. The inter-center reproducibility showed a comparable clustering among identical isolates. Principal component analysis indicated a higher tendency to cluster within the same center. Therefore, we used a discriminant analysis, which completely separated the clusters. Next, we defined a reference center and performed a statistical analysis to identify specific peaks to identify the outbreak clusters. Finally, we used a classifier algorithm and a linear support vector machine on the determined peaks as classifier. A validation showed that within the set of the reference center, the identification of the cluster was 100% correct with a large contrast between the score with the correct cluster and the next best scoring cluster.

While typical machine learning methods require large labeled datasets for training and validation, their application is limited in clinical fields since ground truth information can hardly be obtained on a sizeable cohort of patients. Unsupervised neural networks - such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) - represent an alternative approach to identifying hidden patterns in biomedical data. Here we investigate the feasibility of SOMs for the identification of malignant and non-malignant regions in liquid biopsies of thyroid nodules, on a patient-specific basis. MALDI-ToF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization -Time of Flight) mass spectrometry-imaging (MSI) was used to measure the spectral profile of bioptic samples. SOMs were then applied for the analysis of MALDI-MSI data of individual patients' samples, also testing various pre-processing and agglomerative clustering methods to investigate their impact on SOMs' discrimination efficacy. The final clustering was compared against the sample's probability to be malignant, hyperplastic or related to Hashimoto thyroiditis as quantified by multinomial regression with LASSO. Our results show that SOMs are effective in separating the areas of a sample containing benign cells from those containing malignant cells. Moreover, they allow to overlap the different areas of cytological glass slides with the corresponding proteomic profile image, and inspect the specific weight of every cellular component in bioptic samples. We envision that this approach could represent an effective means to assist pathologists in diagnostic tasks, avoiding the need to manually annotate cytological images and the effort in creating labeled datasets.",English,"Green Published, hybrid",Article,"Self-Organizing Maps; Unsupervised learning; MALDI-MSI; Mass

From the 473 MALDI-TOF-confirmed GPCN samples, 155 were S. dysgalactiae (33%); 150, S. uberis (32%); 112, L. lactis (24%); 16, L. garvieae (3%); and 40, other GPCN (8%). From these, 277 were CM samples and 127 were eligible for the evaluation of SCC resolution, which was defined as SCC <= 200,000 cells/mL in a composite sample 15 to 60 d post-diagnosis. The odds of SCC resolution in CM samples was evaluated with multivariable logistic regression, and the odds were 6.1 [95% confidence interval (CI):2.7-13.9] times higher for S. dysgalactiae or S. uberis compared with L. lactis or L. garvieae. In phase II, a total of 1,662 CM arid SCM samples were evaluated with microbiological methods as in phase I, of which 211 samples were confirmed by MALDI-TOF: 39% were S. dysgalactiae (n = 61) and S. uberis (n = 21); 55%, L. lactis n = 114) and L. garvieae (n = 2); and 6%, other GPCN (n = 13). In total, 168 CM samples were eligible for analysis and 118 were included in the final SCC resolution model. Similar statistical methods as in phase I were performed, arid the odds of SCC resolution were 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1-5.5) times higher for S. dysgalactiae or S. uberis compared with L. lactis or L. garvieae. Bacteriological cure was defined as having a different or negative culture on a quarter sample taken 14 to 28 d after initial diagnosis. The odds of bacteriological cure (n = 121) were 8.0 (95% CI: 2.5-25.6) times higher for S. dysgalactiae or S. uberis compared with L. lactis or L. garvieae.

Abnormal N-glycan patterns have been found in various diseases compared to healthy controls. A decrease in terminal galactosylated N-glycans of serum IgG in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) may be involved in their immunopathogenesis. However, how glycan patterns differ between RA and OA remains unclear. Here, we identified 15 glycan forms of serum IgG from RA and OA using MALDI-TOF MS. We found that IgG galactosylation represented a suitable candidate for differentiating RA from healthy controls (AUC > 0.9). Then, we performed binary logistic regression to screen out three bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) glycoforms for distinguishing between OA and RA. Combined ROC analysis of the selected glycans yielded an AUC of 0.81 between OA and RA and an AUC of 0.79 between OA and RF/ACPA negative RA. Similar results were found in the validation set. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that RA and OA are distinguished on the basis of their different IgG glycan patterns, which thus serve as suitable candidates as biomarkers for reliably identifying clinical conditions such as RA and OA.",English,,Article,

The aim of the present study was to identify novel markers of Schistosoma mansoni infection and disease using urine samples from a large cohort from an area endemic for S. mansoni. Experimental design: Urine samples were collected and processed on an automated sample clean-up and fractionation system combining strong cation exchange and reversed phase, and analyzed by MS (MALDI ToF MS). The ClinPro Tools(TM) (CPT) software and the Discrete Wavelet Transformation-Support Vector Machine (DWT-SVM) procedure were used for classification and statistical analysis. Results: We observed a large difference in urinary peptide profiles between children and adults but classification based on infection was possible only for children. Here, in the external validation data set, 93% of the infected children were classified correctly with DWT-SVM (versus 76% for CPT). In addition 91% of low-infected children were classified correctly using DWT-SVM (versus 85% for CPT). The discriminating peptides were identified as fragments of collagen 1A1 and 1A3, and uromodulin.

It is therefore important to develop rapid and reliable methods for early diagnosis. To achieve this aim, identification of accurate biomarkers will promote research into the mechanisms of schizophrenia and the design of effective diagnosis tools. Discriminative peptides in the serum of participants (277 schizophrenia patients and 294 healthy controls) were detected using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The diagnostic model for schizophrenia was validated using the ClinProTool software. Discrimination models were tested in the training set (200 schizophrenia patients and 200 healthy controls), and the robustness of the models was evaluated using the independent test set (77 cases and 94 controls). A total of 77 peaks were significantly different between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls with a signal-to-noise ratio of over 5. Among them, 35 peptides were down-regulated and 42 peptides were up-regulated in schizophrenia patients. With a cross-validation rate of 92.7% and a recognition capability rate of 96.5%, the supervised neural network comprising 25 discriminative peaks was found to be the most efficient model for schizophrenia diagnosis (sensitivity = 96.10%, specificity = 94.68%). Peptides at m/z = 2022.18 corresponded to complement C3f, and peptides at m/z = 1020.89, 1351.02, 1466.1 were identified as fragments of fibrinopeptide A.

Infections with vancomycin-nonsusceptible MRSA, including vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous VISA (hVISA), are clinically challenging and are associated with poor patient outcomes. The identification of VISA in the clinical laboratory depends on standard susceptibility testing, which takes at least 24 h to complete after isolate subculture, whereas hVISA is not routinely detected in clinical labs. We therefore sought to determine whether VISA and hVISA can be differentiated from vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) using the spectra produced by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Strains of MRSA were characterized for vancomycin susceptibility phenotype by broth microdilution and modified population analysis. We tested 21 VISA, 21 hVISA, and 38 VSSA isolates by MALDI-TOF MS. Susceptibility phenotypes were separated by using a support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm. The resulting model was validated by leave-one-out cross validation. Models were developed and validated by using spectral profiles generated under various subculture conditions, as well as with and without hVISA strains. Using SVM, we correctly identified 100% of the VISA and 97% of the VSSA isolates with an overall classification accuracy of 98%. Addition of hVISA to the model resulted in 76% hVISA identification, 100% VISA identification, and 89% VSSA identification, for an overall classification accuracy of 89%.

In this study, serum N-glycan profiles of 275 NSCLC patients and 309 healthy controls were characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS. The levels of serum N-glycans and N-glycosylation patterns were compared between NSCLC and control groups. In addition, a panel of N-glycan biomarkers for NSCLC diagnosis was established and validated using machine learning algorithms. As a result, a total of 54 N-glycan structures were identified in human serum. Compared with healthy controls, 29 serum N-glycans were increased or decreased in NSCLC patients. N-glycan abundance in different histological types or clinical stages of NSCLC presented differentiated changes. Furthermore, an optimal biomarker panel of eight N-glycans was constructed based on logistic regression, with an AUC of 0.86 in the validation set. Notably, this model also showed a desirable capacity in distinguishing early-stage patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.88).

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a rapid and reliable laboratory-based matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis method for identifying B. anthracis spores in suspicious powder samples. A reference library containing 22 different Bacillus sp. strains or hoax materials was constructed and coupled with a novel classification algorithm and standardized processing protocol for various powder samples. The method's limit of B. anthracis detection was determined to be 2.5 x 10(6) spores, equivalent to a 55-mu g sample size of the crudest B. anthracis-containing powder discovered during the 2001 Amerithrax incidents. The end-to-end analysis method was able to successfully discriminate among samples containing B. anthracis spores, closely related Bacillus sp. spores, and commonly encountered hoax materials. No false-positive or -negative classifications of B. anthracis spores were observed, even when the analysis method was challenged with a wide range of other bacterial agents. The robustness of the method was demonstrated by analyzing samples (i) at an external facility using a different MALDI-TOF MS instrument, (ii) using an untrained operator, and (iii) using mixtures of Bacillus sp. spores and hoax materials. Taken together, the observed performance of the analysis method developed demonstrates its potential applicability as a rapid, specific, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective laboratory-based analysis tool for resolving incidents involving suspicious powders in less than 30 min.",English,"Green Published, Bronze",Article,

However, the molecular roles of BL in kernel development have not been fully elucidated. In this work, microscopy images showed that BL began to appear at a growth stage earlier than 10 days after pollination (DAP), and its color gradually deepened to become dark as the development period progressed. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that BL is a tissue structure composed of several layers of cells that are gradually squeezed and compressed during kernel development. Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) was used to sample BL and its neighboring inner tissue, basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), and outer tissue, inner epidermis (IEP), from 20 DAP of kernels. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiling (MALDI-TOF MS profiling) detected 41, 104, and 120 proteins from LCM-sampled BL, BETL, and IEP, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the 41 BL proteins were primarily involved in the response to stress and stimuli. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis found that the BL proteins were enriched in several defense pathways, such as the ascorbate and aldarate metabolic pathways. Among the 41 BL proteins, six were BL-specific proteins that were only detected from BL. Annotations of five BL-specific proteins were related to stress responses. During kernel development, transcriptional expression of most BL proteins showed an increase, followed by a decrease, and reached a maximum zero to 20 DAP. These results suggest a role for BL in stress responses for protecting filial tissue against threats from maternal sides, which helps to elucidate the biological functions of BL.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"maize; black layer; seed development; proteomic analysis; stress

Due to the lack of a fast and sensitive diagnostic method, PCa is only recognized in the late stadium of the disease. For this purpose, new tools are sought for sensitive diagnosis. One of them is the use of mass spectrometry. The main goal of the study was to perform target lipidomic analysis of prostate tissue with the use of two imaging methods: matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and electrospray ionization with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Statistical evaluation provided the knowledge about the phospholipids alteration linked with PCa progression. In practice, its recognition enables development of a quick and sensitive diagnostic method. The acquired knowledge may also lead to the increasement of hormone therapies effectiveness. The main goal of this study was to explore the phospholipid alterations associated with the development of prostate cancer (PCa) using two imaging methods: matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF/MS), and electrospray ionization with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-QqQ/MS). For this purpose, samples of PCa tissue (n = 40) were evaluated in comparison to the controls (n = 40). As a result, few classes of compounds, namely phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), were determined. The obtained results were evaluated by univariate (Mann-Whitney U-test) and multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis, correlation analysis, volcano plot, artificial neural network, and random forest algorithm), in order to select the most discriminative features and to search for the relationships between the responses of these groups of substances, also in terms of the used analytical technique. Based on previous literature and our results, it can be assumed that PCa is linked with both the synthesis of fatty acids and lipid oxidation. Among the compounds, phospholipids, namely PC 16:0/16:1, PC 16:0/18:2, PC 18:0/22:5, PC 18:1/18:2, PC 18:1/20:0, PC 18:1/20:4, and SM d18:1/24:0, were assigned as metabolites with the best discriminative power for the tested groups.

Traditionally, this process relies either on MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, on biochemical tests and on the observation of the morphology of colonies after growth on a Petri disk Here is presented an innovative method for label-free optical identification of pathogens, based on the multispectral infrared imaging of colonies. This lensless imaging technique enables a high-throughput analysis and wide-field analysis of agar plates. It could yield very high correct identification rates as it relies on an optical fingerprint gathering both spectroscopic and morphologic features. The setup consists of a Quantum Cascade Lasers light source and an imager, a square 2.72 by 2.72 mm uncooled bolometer array. Microorganisms to be analyzed are streaked on a porous growth support compatible with infrared imaging, laid on top of an agar plate for incubation. When imaging is performed, growth support is put in close contact with the imaging sensor and illuminated at different wavelengths. After acquisition, an image descriptor based on spectral and morphological features is extracted for each microbial colony. Supervised classification is finally performed with a Support Vector Machine algorithm and tested with tenfold cross-validation. A first database collecting 1012 multispectral images of colonies belonging to five different species has already been acquired with this system, resulting in a correct identification rate of 92%. For these experiments, multispectral images are acquired at nine different wavelengths, between 5.6 and 8 mu m. Considering the optimization possibilities of the image descriptors currently used and the ongoing development of the uncooled bolometers technology, these very first results are promising and could be dramatically improved with further experiments.

Here an experimental method to identify surface lysine residues by NHS-biotin chemical modification combined with MALDI-TOF MS was proposed and was evaluated using PH1033 protein from Pyrococcus horikoshii. Interestingly, the biotinylation experiment with a protein-reagent molar ratio of 1:1 revealed that only seven of twenty-two lysine residues in the protein comprising 144 residues were labeled. To investigate the result, we analyzed structures from a molecular-dynamics simulation mimicking the experiment. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the biotinylation was significantly correlated with four factors relevant to the local environment of lysine residues: the solvent accessibility, the electrostatic energy, the number of hydrogen bonds, and the estimated pKa value. This result is overall in agreement with that from the same analysis on the crystal structure. However, reflecting the flexibility of the protein molecule in solution state, the factors except for the electrostatic energy were highly variable in the MD structures depending upon the protonation state of Tyr87. The present procedure of biotin-labeling can avoid lysine residues with extensive intramolecular interactions that are incompatible with the rational design of protein crystals.",English,,Article,"Lysine; Chemical modification; MALDI-TOF MS; Molecular dynamics;

One key problem with the mass spectrometric analysis of peptides and proteins, however, is the fact that absolute quantification is severely hampered by the unclear relationship between the observed peak intensity and the peptide concentration in the sample. While there are numerous approaches to circumvent this problem experimentally (e. g. labeling techniques), reliable prediction of the peak intensities from peptide sequences could provide a peptide-specific correction factor. Thus, it would be a valuable tool towards label-free absolute quantification. Results: In this work we present machine learning techniques for peak intensity prediction for MALDI mass spectra. Features encoding the peptides' physico-chemical properties as well as string-based features were extracted. A feature subset was obtained from multiple forward feature selections on the extracted features. Based on these features, two advanced machine learning methods (support vector regression and local linear maps) are shown to yield good results for this problem (Pearson correlation of 0.68 in a ten-fold cross validation).

By modeling mass spectra as functions, this approach avoids reliance on peak detection methods. The flexibility of this framework in modeling nonparametric fixed and random effect functions enables it to model the effects of multiple factors simultaneously, allowing one to perform inference on multiple factors of interest using the same model fit, while adjusting for clinical or experimental covariates that may affect both the intensities and locations of peaks in the spectra. For example, this provides a straightforward way to account for systematic block and batch effects that characterize these data. From the model output, we identify spectral regions that are differentially expressed across experimental conditions, in a way that takes both statistical and clinical significance into account and controls the Bayesian false discovery rate to a prespecified level. We apply this method to two cancer studies.",English,Green Accepted,Article,"Bayesian analysis; false discovery rate; functional data analysis;

MALDI-TOF-MS technology has become a tool of choice for microbial identification but has several drawbacks: it requires a long step of bacterial culture before analysis (?24 h), has a low specificity and is not quantitative. We developed a new strategy for identifying bacterial species in urine using specific LC-MS/MS peptidic signatures. In the first training step, libraries of peptides are obtained on pure bacterial colonies in DDA mode, their detection in urine is then verified in DIA mode, followed by the use of machine learning classifiers (NaiveBayes, BayesNet and Hoeffding tree) to define a peptidic signature to distinguish each bacterial species from the others. Then, in the second step, this signature is monitored in unknown urine samples using targeted proteomics. This method, allowing bacterial identification in less than 4 h, has been applied to fifteen species representing 84% of all Urinary Tract Infections. More than 31,000 peptides in 190 samples were quantified by DIA and classified by machine learning to determine an 82 peptides signature and build a prediction model. This signature was validated for its use in routine using Parallel Reaction Monitoring on two different instruments. Linearity and reproducibility of the method were demonstrated as well as its accuracy on donor specimens. Within 4h and without bacterial culture, our method was able to predict the predominant bacteria infecting a sample in 97% of cases and 100% above the standard threshold. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our method for the rapid and specific identification of the bacterial species causing UTI and could be extended in the future to other biological specimens and to bacteria having specific virulence or resistance factors. We have developed a new method for the identification of bacterial species causing Urinary Tract Infections. The first training step used DIA analysis on multiple replicates of bacterial inoculates to define a peptide signature by machine learning classifiers. In a second identification step, the signature is monitored by targeted proteomics on unknown samples. This fast, culture-free and accurate method paves the way of the development of new diagnostic approaches limiting the emergence of antimicrobial resistances.",English,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",Article,"Microbiology; bacteria; SWATH-MS; tandem mass spectrometry; targeted

Currently, exosomes for liquid biopsy have been applied in diagnosis and monitoring of diseases, whereas SLE discrimination based on exosomes at the metabolic level is rarely reported. Herein, we constructed a protocol for metabolomic study of urinary exosomes from SLE patients and healthy controls (HCs) with high efficiency and throughput. Exosomes were first obtained by high-performance liquid size-exclusion chromatography (HPL-SEC), and then metabolic fingerprints of urinary exosomes were extracted by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with high throughput and high efficency. With the statistical analysis by orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model, SLE patients were efficiently distinguished from HCs, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver characteristic curve (ROC) was 1.00, and the accuracy of the unsupervised clustering heatmap was 90.32%.

The aim of this study was to discover and identify potential protein biomarkers specific for breast cancer. Methods Two hundred and eighty-two ( 282) serum samples with 124 breast cancer and 158 controls were randomly divided into a training set and a blind-testing set. Serum proteomic profiles were analyzed using SELDI-TOF-MS. Candidate biomarkers were purified by HPLC, identified by LC-MS/MS and validated using Protein-Chip immunoassays and western blot technique. Results A total of 3 peaks (m/z with 6,630, 8,139 and 8,942 Da) were screened out by support vector machine to construct the classification model with high discriminatory power in the training set. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 96.45 and 94.87%, respectively, in the blind-testing set. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 6,630 Da was found to be down-regulated in breast cancer patients, and was identified as apolipoprotein C-I. Another two candidate biomarkers (8,139, 8,942 Da) were found up-regulated in breast cancer and identified as C-terminal-truncated form of C3a and complement component C3a, respectively. In addition, the level of apolipoprotein C-I progressively decreased with the clinical stages I, II, III and IV, and the expression of C-terminal-truncated form of C3a and complement component C3a gradually increased in higher stages.

Unfortunately, the adulteration of EVOO with less expensive oils (e.g., peanut and corn oils), has become one of the biggest source of agricultural fraud in the European Union, with important health implications for consumers, mainly due to the introduction of seed oil-derived allergens causing, especially in children, severe food allergy phenomena. In this regard, revealing adulterations of EVOO is of fundamental importance for health care and prevention reasons, especially in children. To this aim, effective analytical methods to assess EVOO purity are necessary. Here, we propose a simple, rapid, robust and very sensitive method for non-specialized mass spectrometric laboratory, based on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC), principal component (PCA) and Pearson's correlation analyses, to reveal corn oil (CO) adulterations in EVOO at very low levels (down to 0.5%).",English,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",Article,"mediterranean diet; extra-virgin olive oil; corn oil; MALDI-TOF MS;

Here we show that spectral profiles acquired from clinical isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) can be used to implement diagnostic classifiers based on machine learning for the successful discrimination of environmental and contagious S. uberis strains. Classifiers dedicated to individual farms achieved up to 97.81% accuracy at cross-validation when using a genetic algorithm, with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.94. This indicates the potential of the proposed methodology to successfully support screening at the herd level. A global classifier developed on merged data from 19 farms achieved 95.88% accuracy at cross-validation (kappa 0.93) and 70.67% accuracy at external validation (kappa 0.34), using data from another 10 farms left as holdout. This indicates that more work is needed to develop a screening solution successful at the population level. Significant MALDI-TOF spectral peaks were extracted from the trained classifiers. The peaks were found to correspond to bacteriocin and ribosomal proteins, suggesting that immunity, growth and competition over nutrients may be correlated to the different transmission routes.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,

Rapid and accurate strain typing of bacteria would facilitate epidemiological investigation and infection control in near real time. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and cost-effective tool for presumptive strain typing. To develop robust method for strain typing based on MALDI-TOF spectrum, machine learning (ML) is a promising algorithm for the construction of predictive model. In this study, a strategy of building templates of specific types was used to facilitate generating predictive models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain typing through various ML methods. The strain types of the isolates were determined through multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the predictive accuracy of the models were compared. ST5, ST59, and ST239 were the major MLST types, and ST45 was the minor type. For binary classification, the AUC values of various ML methods ranged from 0.76 to 0.99 for ST5, ST59, and ST239 types.

Herein, we present an integrated strategy for isolating and analyzing exosomes from human plasma rapidly and then discriminating different cancers excellently based on deep learning fingerprints of plasma exosomes. Sequential size-exclusion chromatography (SSEC) was developed efficiently for separating exosomes from human plasma. SSEC isolated plasma exosomes, taking as less as 2 h for a single sample with high purity such that the discard rates of high-density lipoproteins and low/very low-density lipoproteins were 93 and 85%, respectively. Benefitting from the rapid and high-purity isolation, the contents encapsulated in exosomes, covered by plasma proteins, were well profiled by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS). We further analyzed 220 clinical samples, including 79 breast cancer patients, 57 pancreatic cancer patients, and 84 healthy controls. After MS data pre-processing and feature selection, the extracted MS feature peaks were utilized as inputs for constructing a multi-classifier artificial neural network (denoted as Exo-ANN) model. The optimized model avoided overfitting and performed well in both training cohorts and test cohorts. For the samples in the independent test cohort, it realized a diagnosed accuracy of 80.0% with an area under the curve of 0.91 for the whole group.

To ascertain whether proteomic based molecular profiling in conjunction with artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms could be applied towards the specific recognition of phenotypic patterns between either control or drug treated and chemosensitive or chemoresistant cellular populations, a combined approach involving MALDI-TOF matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, Ciphergen protein chip technology and ANN algorithms have been applied to specifically identify proteomic 'fingerprints' indicative of treatment regimen for chemosensitive (MCF-7, T47D) and chemoresistant (MCF-7/ADR) breast cancer cell lines following exposure to Doxorubicin or Paclitaxel. The results indicate that proteomic patterns can be identified by ANN algorithms to correctly assign 'class' for treatment regimen (e.g. control/drug treated or chemosensitive/chemoresistant) with a high degree of accuracy using boot-strap statistical validation techniques and that biomarker ion patterns indicative of response/non-response phenotypes are associated with MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells exposed to Doxorubicin. We have also examined the predictive capability of this approach towards MCF-7 and T47D cells to ascertain whether prediction could be made based upon treatment regimen irrespective of cell lineage. Models were identified that could correctly assign class (control or Paclitaxel treatment) for 35/38 samples of an independent dataset. A similar level of predictive capability was also found (> 92%; n = 28) when proteomic patterns derived from the drug resistant cell line MCF-7/ADR were compared against those derived from MCF-7 and T47D as a model system of drug resistant and drug sensitive phenotypes. This approach might offer a potential methodology for predicting the biological behaviour of cancer cells towards particular chemotherapeutics and through protein isolation and sequence identification could result in the identification of biological molecules associated with chemosensitive/chemoresistance tumour phenotypes.",English,,Article,artificial neural network; SELDI

We sought to gain insights into N-glycosylation to uncover yet unexplored pathophysiological mechanisms in type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using a high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry method, we measured N-glycans in plasma samples of the DiaGene case-control study (1583 cases and 728 controls). Associations were investigated with logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and smoking. Findings were replicated in a nested replication cohort of 232 cases and 108 controls. Results: Eighteen glycosylation features were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Fucosylation and bisection of diantennary glycans were decreased in diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, p = 1.26E-03, and OR = 0.87, p = 2.84E-02, respectively), whereas total and, specifically, alpha2,6-linked sialylation were increased (OR = 1.38, p = 9.92E-07, and OR = 1.40, p = 5.48E-07). Alpha2,3-linked sialylation of triantennary glycans was decreased (OR = 0.60, p = 6.38E-11). Conclusions: While some glycosylation changes were reflective of inflammation, such as increased alpha2,6-linked sialylation, our finding of decreased alpha2,3-linked sialylation in type 2 diabetes patients is contradictory to reports on acute and chronic inflammation.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A training group of patients suffering from ALI/ARDS was compiled from equal numbers of survivors and nonsurvivors. Clinical history, ventilation parameters, Murray's lung injury severity score (Murray's LISS) and interleukins in BALF were gathered. In addition, samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were analyzed by means of hydrophobic chromatography and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for each clinical and cytokine parameter revealed interleukin-6>interleukin-8>diabetes mellitus>Murray's LISS as the best outcome predictors. Outcome predicted on the basis of BALF levels of interleukin-6 resulted in 79.4% accuracy, 82.7% sensitivity and 76.1% specificity (area under the ROC curve, AUC, 0.853). Both clinical parameters and cytokines as well as peptide patterns determined by MALDI-ToF MS were analyzed by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. CART analysis including Murray's LISS, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in combination was correct in 78.0%. MALDI-ToF MS of BALF peptides did not reveal a single identifiable biomarker for ARDS. However, classification of patients was successfully achieved based on the entire peptide pattern analyzed using SVM. This method resulted in 90% accuracy, 93.3% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity following a 10-fold cross validation (AUC = 0.953). Subsequent validation of the optimized SVM algorithm with a test group of patients with unknown prognosis yielded 87.5% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity.

Fast identification is essential to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a protocol to identify M. bovis from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS and to determine the diagnostic accuracy in comparison with other techniques. BALf was obtained from 104 cattle, and the presence of M. bovis was determined in the following three ways: (i) rapid identification of M. bovis with MALDI-TOF MS (RIMM) (BALf was enriched and after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation and was analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS), (ii) triplex real-time PCR for M. bovis, Mycoplasma bovirhinis, and Mycoplasma dispar, and (iii) 10-day incubation on selective-indicative agar. The diagnostic accuracy of the three tests was determined with Bayesian latent class modeling (BLCM). After 24 h of enrichment, M. bovis was identified with MALDI-TOF MS in 3 out of 104 BALf samples. After 48 and 72 h of enrichment, 32/104 and 38/100 samples, respectively, were M. bovis positive. Lipase-positive Mycoplasma-like colonies were seen in 28 of 104 samples. Real-time PCR resulted in 28/104 positive and 12/104 doubtful results for M. bovis. The BLCM showed a sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of 86.6% (95% credible interval [CI], 69.4% to 97.6%) and 86.4% (CI, 76.1 to 93.8) for RIMM.

The objective of this study was to study changes in serum metabolic characteristics in patients with DKD and to examine metabolite panels to distinguish DKD from diabetes with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry(MALDI-TOF-MS). We recruited 40 type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with or without DKD from a single center for a cross-sectional study. Serum metabolic profiling was performed with MALDI-TOF-MS using a vertical silicon nanowire array. Differential metabolites between DKD and diabetes patients were selected, and their relevance to the clinical parameters of DKD was analyzed. We applied machine learning methods to the differential metabolite panels to distinguish DKD patients from diabetes patients. Twenty-four differential serum metabolites between DKD patients and diabetes patients were identified, which were mainly enriched in butyrate metabolism, TCA cycle, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Among the metabolites, l-kynurenine was positively correlated with urinary microalbumin, urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), creatinine, and urea nitrogen content. l-Serine, pimelic acid, 5-methylfuran-2-carboxylic acid, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, and dihydrouracil were associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The panel of differential metabolites could be used to distinguish between DKD and diabetes patients with an AUC value reaching 0.9899-0.9949.

Extramedullary disease (EMD) represents a more aggressive condition involving the migration of a subclone of plasma cells to paraskeletal or extraskeletal sites. Liquid biopsies could improve and speed diagnosis, as they can better capture the disease heterogeneity while lowering patients' discomfort due to minimal invasiveness. Recent studies have confirmed alterations in the proteome across various malignancies, suggesting specific changes in protein classes. In this study, we show that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry fingerprinting of peripheral blood can differentiate between MM and primary EMD patients. We constructed a predictive model using a supervised learning method, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and evaluated its generalization performance on a test dataset. The outcome of this analysis is a method that predicts specifically primary EMD with high sensitivity (86.4%), accuracy (78.4%), and specificity (72.4%).

Rapid strain typing of pathogenic S. haemolyticus is indispensable in modern public health infectious disease control, facilitating the identification of the origin of infections to prevent further infectious outbreak. Rapid identification enables the effective control of pathogenic infections, which is tremendously beneficial to critically ill patients. However, the existing strain typing methods, such as multi-locus sequencing, are of relatively high cost and comparatively time-consuming. A practical method for the rapid strain typing of pathogens, suitable for routine use in clinics and hospitals, is still not available. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry combined with machine learning approaches is a promising method to carry out rapid strain typing. In this study, we developed a statistical test-based method to determine the reference spectrum when dealing with alignment of mass spectra datasets, and constructed machine learning-based classifiers for categorizing different strains of S. haemolyticus. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy of multi-class predictions were 0.848 and 0.866, respectively. Additionally, we employed a variety of statistical tests and feature-selection strategies to identify the discriminative peaks that can substantially contribute to strain typing.

In mass spectrometry of organic compounds, the internal standard is preferably labelled with a stable isotope, such as O-18, (5)Nor C-13. In this study, a method for the quantification of fructo-oligosaccharides using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) was proposed and tested on raftilose, a partially hydrolysed inulin with a degree of polymeration 2-7. A tetraoligosaccharide nystose, which is chemically identical to the raftilose tetramer, was used as an internal standard rather than an isotope-labelled analyte. Two mathematical approaches used for data processing, conventional calculations and artificial neural networks (ANN). were compared. The conventional data processing relies on the assumption that a constant oligomer dispersion profile will change after the addition of the internal standard and some simple numerical calculations. On the other hand, ANN was found to compensate for a non-linear MALDI response and variations in the oligomer dispersion profile with raftilose concentration. As a result, the application of ANN led to lower quantification errors and excellent day-to-day repeatability compared to the conventional data analysis. The developed method is feasible for MS quantification of raftilose in the range of 10-750 pg with errors below 7%. The content of raftilose was determined in dietary cream; application can be extended to other similar polymers. It should be stressed that no special optimisation of the MALDI process was carried out. A common MALDI matrix and sample preparation were used and only the basic parameters, such as sampling and laser energy, were optimised prior to quantification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a research group developed a machine-learning classifier to distinguish VISA and hVISA from vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) according to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of hVISA classification was found to be 76%, and the program was not completely automated with a graphical user interface. Here, we developed a more accurate machine-learning classifier for discrimination of hVISA from VSSA and VISA among MRSA isolates in Japanese hospitals by means of MALDI-TOF MS data. The classifier showed 99% sensitivity of hVISA classification. Furthermore, we clarified the procedures for preparing samples and obtaining MALDI-TOF MS data and developed all-in-one software, hVISA Classifier, with a graphical user interface that automates the classification and is easy for medical workers to use; it is publicly available at https://github.com/bioprojects/hVISAclassifier.

Accurate assessment of drug resistance is essential for appropriate treatment and prevention of transmission of these deadly pathogens. Early detection of drug resistance in patients is critical for providing timely treatment and reducing the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study aims to develop a novel risk assessment framework for S. aureus that can accurately determine the resistance to multiple antibiotics. The comprehensive 7-year study involved >20 000 isolates with susceptibility testing profiles of six antibiotics. By incorporating mass spectrometry and machine learning, the study was able to predict the susceptibility to four different antibiotics with high accuracy. To validate the accuracy of our models, we externally tested on an independent cohort and achieved impressive results with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 94, 0.90, 0.86 and 0.91, and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.93, 0.87, 0.87 and 0.81, respectively, for oxacillin, clindamycin, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In addition, the framework evaluated the level of multidrug resistance of the isolates by using the predicted drug resistance probabilities, interpreting them in the context of a multidrug resistance risk score and analyzing the performance contribution of different sample groups.

The CNN was trained to classify images of Gram stains based on staining and morphology into seven different classes: background/false-positive, Gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCCL), Gram-positive cocci in pairs (GPCP), Gram-positive cocci in chains (GPCC), rod-shaped bacilli (RSB), yeasts, and polymicrobial specimens. A total of 1,555 Gram-stained slides of PBCs were scanned, pre-classified, and reviewed by medical professionals. The results of assisted Gram stain interpretation were compared to those of manual microscopy and cultural species identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The comparison of assisted Gram stain interpretation and manual microscopy yielded positive/negative percent agreement values of 95.8%/98.0% (GPCCL), 87.6%/99.3% (GPCP/GPCC), 97.4%/97.8% (RSB), 83.3%/99.3% (yeasts), and 87.0%/98.5% (negative/false positive). The assisted Gram stain interpretation, when compared to MALDI-TOF MS species identification, also yielded similar results. During the analytical performance study, assisted interpretation showed excellent reproducibility and repeatability.

Herein we report a label-free method for high-throughput engineering of multistep biochemical reactions based On optically guided MALDI-ToF MS analysis of bacterial colonies. The bacterial cells provide containment of multiple enzymes and access to substrates and cofactors via metabolism. Automated MALDI-ToF MS acquisition from randomly distributed colonies simplifies procedures to prepare strain libraries without liquid handling. MALDI-ToF MS profiling was utilized to screen both substrate and enzyme libraries for natural product biosynthesis. Computational algorithms were developed to process and visualize the resulting mass spectral data sets. For analogues of the peptidic antibiotic plantazolicin, multivariate analyses by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding were used to group similar spectra for rapid identification of nonisobatic variants. After MALDI-ToF MS screening, follow-up analyses using high-resolution MS and tandem MS were readily performed on the same sample target. Separately, relative ion intensities of rhamnolipid congeners with various lipid moieties were evaluated to engineer enzymatic specificity. The glycolipid profiles of each colony were overlaid with optical images to facilitate the recovery of desirable mutants. For both the antibiotic and rhamnolipid cases, large populations of colonies were rapidly surveyed at the molecular level, providing information-rich insights not easily obtained with traditional screening assays. Utilizing standard microbiological techniques with routine microscopy and MALDI-ToF MS instruments, this simple yet effective workflbw is applicable for a wide range of screening campaigns targeting multistep enzymatic reactions.",English,"Green Published, Bronze",Article,

Many machine learning methods have been used to construct classifiers based on mass spectrometry data, for discrimination between cancer stages. However, the classifiers generated by machine learning such as SVM techniques typically lack biological interpretability.

Fast and accurate detection of bacterial infection is essential to provide appropriate antibiotherapy to patients and to avoid the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. While the gold standard requires 24 h to 48 h of bacteria culture prior to MALDI-TOF species identification, we propose a culture-free workflow, enabling bacterial identification and quantification in less than 4 h using 1 ml of urine. After rapid and automatable sample preparation, a signature of 82 bacterial peptides, defined by machine learning, was monitored in LC-MS, to distinguish the 15 species causing 84% of the UTIs. The combination of the sensitivity of the SRM mode on a triple quadrupole TSQ Altis instrument and the robustness of capillary flow enabled us to analyze up to 75 samples per day, with 99.2% accuracy on bacterial inoculations of healthy urines. We have also shown our method can be used to quantify the spread of the infection, from 8 x 104 to 3 x 107 CFU/ml. Finally, the workflow was validated on 45 inoculated urines and on 84 UTI-positive urine from patients, with respectively 93.3% and 87.1% of agreement with the culture-MALDI procedure at a level above 1 x 105 CFU/ml corresponding to an infection requiring antibiotherapy.",English,Green Submitted,Article,

However, today, only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide-field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach through the acquisition and the subsequent analysis of a dataset comprising 252 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and interspecies variability, a scenario considerably more akin to real-world clinical practice than the one achievable by solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite this variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7%. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.

A Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 4 classification prompts a biopsy that most often reveals benign disease. Our objective was to determine if serum protein-expression profiles could be used to differentiate between benign and malignant mammographic lesions. STUDY DESIGN: After IRB approval, women undergoing an image-guided biopsy for a BIRADS category 4 lesion were recruited. Serum was collected prebiopsy and labeled retrospectively after final pathology was reviewed. Serum was incubated with weak cation exchange magnetic beads and assayed in duplicate for analysis on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) instrumentation (Bruker Daltonics). Spectra were analyzed using ClinProTools 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonics), and classifications determined using a genetic-clustering algorithm. RESULTS: In a 14-month period, 260 subjects were recruited into this study. Sera from 92 subjects were randomly selected to form benign (n = 46) and cancer (n = 46) cohorts. The MALDI-TOF spectra analysis yielded 273 peaks, with 14 peaks expressed differentially (p < 0.05) between the cancer and benign cohorts.

The lack of tools to monitor the immunological status in sepsis constrains the development of therapies. Here, we evaluated a test based on whole plasma peptidome acquired by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometer and machine-learning algorithms to discriminate two lipopolysaccharide-(LPS) induced murine models emulating the pro- and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppression environments that can be found during sepsis. The LPS group was inoculated with a single high dose of LPS and the IS group was subjected to increasing doses of LPS, to induce proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppression profiles respectively. The LPS group showed leukopenia and higher levels of cytokines and tissue damage markers, and the IS group showed neutrophilia, lymphopenia and decreased humoral response. Principal component analysis of the plasma peptidomes formed discrete clusters that mostly coincided with the experimental groups. In addition, machine-learning algorithms discriminated the different experimental groups with a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 90.9%. Data reveal the potential of plasma fingerprints analysis by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry as a simple, speedy and readily transferrable method for sepsis patient stratification that would contribute to therapeutic decision-making based on their immunological status.",English,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",Article,

The present study was conducted to investigate the alterations in the serum proteome in GBM patients compared to healthy controls. Comparative proteomic analysis was performed employing classical 2DE and 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF MS and results were further validated through Western blotting and immunoturbidimetric assay. Comparison of the serum proteome of GBM and healthy subjects revealed 55 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p <0.05) protein spots. Among the identified proteins, haptoglobin, plasminogen precursor, apolipoprotein A-1 and M, and transthyretin are very significant due to their functional consequences in glioma tumor growth and migration, and could further be studied as glioma biomarkers and grade-specific protein signatures. Analysis of the lipoprotein pattern indicated elevated serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoproteins in GBM patients. Functional pathway analysis was performed using multiple software including ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER), database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID), and GeneSpring to investigate the biological context of the identified proteins, which revealed the association of candidate proteins in a few essential physiological pathways such as intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway, plasminogen activating cascade, coagulation system, glioma invasiveness signaling, and PI3K signaling in B lymphocytes. A subset of the differentially expressed proteins was applied to build statistical sample class prediction models for discrimination of GBM patients and healthy controls employing partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and other machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, and excellent discrimination between GBM and control groups was accomplished.",English,,Article,Biomedicine; 2D-DIGE; Glioblastoma multiforme; Glioma; Serum biomarker

Wheat grain proteins are classified into albumins, globulins, and prolamins. The nonprolamin fractions include proteins with metabolic activity or structural function. In order to investigate the consequences of heat stress on the accumulation of nonprolamin proteins in mature durum wheat kernels, the Italian cultivar Svevo was subjected to two thermal regimes (heat stress versus control). The 2-D patterns of nonprolamin proteins were monitored to identify polypeptides affected by heat stress during grain fill. This study shows that heat stress alters significantly the durum wheat seed proteome, although the changes range is only between 1.2- and 2.2-fold. This analysis revealed 132 differentially expressed polypeptides, 47 of which were identified by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF-TOF MS and included HSPs, proteins involved in the glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as stress-related proteins.

The rapid identification of fungi species in contaminated goods is important to avoid further contamination. To this end, we developed a fungal discrimination method based on the bioimage informatics approach of colony fingerprinting. This method involves imaging and visualizing microbial colonies (referred to as colony fingerprints) using a lens-less imaging system. Subsequently, the quantitative image features were extracted as discriminative parameters and subjected to analysis using machine learning approaches. Colony fingerprinting has been previously found to be a promising approach to discriminate bacteria. In the present proof-of-concept study, we tested whether this method is also useful for fungal discrimination. As a result, 5 fungi belonging to the Aspergillus, Peniciliwn, Eurottum, Alternaria, and Fusarium genera were successfully discriminated based on the extracted parameters, including the number of hyphae and their branches, and their intensity distributions on the images. The discrimination of 6 closely-related Aspergillus spp. was also demonstrated using additional parameters. The cultivation time required to generate the fungal colonies with a sufficient size for colony fingerprinting was less than 48 h, shorter than those for other discrimination methods, including MALDI-TOF-MS. In addition, colony fingerprinting did not require any cumbersome pre-treatment steps prior to discrimination. Colony fingerprinting is promising for the rapid and easy discrimination of fungi for use in the ensuring the safety of food manufacturing.",English,Bronze,Article,"Colony fingerprinting; Bioimage informatics; Fungi; Machine learning;

GC-EI-MS spectra of yogurt carbohydrates were classified using machine learning, and structure-relative retention time relationships were calculated determining the abundance of specific fragments on larger oligosaccharide structures. All information generated was correlated using a convolutional network that established characteristic patterns in the complete carbohydrate fraction of each yogurt, as well as changes during fermentation in the carbohydrate profile. It was found that di-, tri- and tetra-POS formed by rhamnose and xylose attached to acetylated-galacturonic acid were released during fermentation in yogurts with artichoke POS.

This model favorably compares with other LDA and ANN models developed in this work and Machine Learning classifiers published before to address the same problem in different aspects. These mt-QSARs offer also a good opportunity to construct drug-protein Complex Networks (CNs) that can be used to explore large and complex drug-protein receptors databases.

We evaluated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS in identifying nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) using the ASTA MicroIDSys system (ASTA Inc., Suwon, Korea) with the MycoDB v1.95s and upgraded MycoDB v2.0-beta databases. We tested 124 NTM isolates collected from Ogawa medium at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, between January and April 2019. MicroIDSys scores were categorized into three groups: >= 140, reliable identification; 130-139, ambiguous identification; and <130, invalid identification. To validate the results, we used the reverse blot hybridization assay (Molecutech REBA MycoID, YD Diagnostics Corp., Korea). Initial analysis using MycoDB v1.95s resulted in 26.6% (33/124) reliable, 43.5% (54/124) ambiguous, and 29.8% (37/124) invalid identifications. Re-analysis using the upgraded MycoDB v2.0-beta database resulted in 94.4% (117/124) reliable, 4.0% (5/124) ambiguous, and 1.6% invalid (2/124) identifications. The percentage of reliable identifications that matched with the reference increased from 26.6% (33/124) with MycoDB v1.95s to 93.5% (116/124) with MycoDB v2.0-beta. The upgraded databases enable substantially improved NTM identification through deep learning in the inference algorithm and by considering more axes in the correlation analysis. MALDI-TOF MS using the upgraded database unambiguously identified most NTM species.

Methods for selective enrichment, accurate identification and easy acquisition of EAB fingerprints for phylogenetic characterization would facilitate utilization of these bioenergy-producing species in practical environmental engineering applications. METHODS: Electricigens/exoelectrogens were selectively enriched from domestic wastewater in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Whole EAB cell-derived mass spectra were obtained with simple agar incubation for 24h and subsequent release of proteins by 25% formic acid (FA) and ultrasonication. Mass fingerprints of EAB were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) and species-specific analyses were completed by using the Spectral ARchive and Microbial Identification System (SARAMIS). RESULTS: EAB could be discriminated by clustering of MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS results. Different species in mixtures originating from domestic sewage could be identified unambiguously at 99.90% confidence. Five species, namely Klebsiella oxytoca (K. oxytoca), Comamonas testosterone (C. testosterone), Pseudomonas putida (P. putida), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) and Raoultella ornithinolytica (R. ornithinolytica), that are known to be of clinical significance, were found to be enriched in MFCs and determined as high power-producing species. By using an agglomerative clustering algorithm to compute spectral similarity and diversity, a dendrogram was constructed to illustrate the phylogenetic relationships for EAB on the basis of mass spectral analyses. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated method based on MFC-enrichment, agar-cultivation and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS identification of whole-cell-extracted proteins has been proved to be a simple, rapid and reliable approach for rapid identification and routine inspection of EAB. Mixed phyla can be analyzed at species level to provide phylogenetic information on the highly efficient bacteria generating electricity from domestic wastewater.

Recent atypical trends prompted review of 42 suspected MRSA isolates. Species identification was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and methicillin resistance was reevaluated by PBP2a lateral flow assay, cefoxitin/oxacillin susceptibility testing, mecA and mecC PCR, and six commercially available MRSA detection agars. All isolates were confirmed S. aureus, but only eight were MRSA (cefoxitin resistant, PBP2a positive, mecA positive, growth on all MRSA screening agars). One MRSA isolate was cefoxitin susceptible but PBP2a and mecA positive, and the remaining 33 were cefoxitin susceptible, PBP2a negative, and mecA negative; interestingly, these isolates grew inconsistently across MRSA screening agars and had susceptibility profiles consistent with that of borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA). Comparative genomic analyses found these BORSA isolates to be phylogenetically diverse and not representative of clonal expansion or shared gene content, though clones of two NICU strains were infrequently observed over 8 months. We identified 6 features-substitutions and truncations in PBP2, PBP4, and GdpP and beta-lactamase hyperproduction-that were used to generate a random forest classifier to distinguish BORSA from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in our cohort. Our model demonstrated a robust ability to predict the BORSA phenotype among isolates collected across two continents (validation area under the curve [AUC], 0.902). Taking these findings together, we observed an unexpected prevalence of BORSA in our NICU, BORSA misclassification by existing MRSA screening methods, and markers that are together discriminatory for BORSA and MSSA within our cohort. This work has implications for epidemiological reporting of MRSA rates for centers using different screening methods. IMPORTANCE In this study, we found a high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus isolates exhibiting a borderline oxacillin resistance phenotype (BORSA) in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) serendipitously due to the type of MRSA screening agar used by our laboratory for active surveillance cultures. Subsequent phenotypic and molecular characterization highlighted an unexpected prevalence and variability of BORSA isolates. Through whole-genome sequencing, we interrogated core and accessory genome content and generated a random forest classification model to identify mutations and truncations in the PBP2, PBP4, and GdpP proteins and beta-lactamase hyperproduction, which correlated with BORSA and MSSA phenotypes among S. aureus clinical isolates collected across two continents. In consideration of these findings, this work will help clinical microbiology laboratories and clinicians identify MRSA screening shortfalls and draw attention to the non-mecA-mediated BORSA phenotype.",English,Green Published,Article,"oxacillin; BORSA; MRSA; WGS; NGS; surveillance cultures; chromogenic

It is the main source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants of potential nutritional value in the wheat kernel. The AL of three varieties of each of the two main species of wheat, Triticum aestivum (ABD) and Triticum durum (AB), were manually dissected and analysed using two-dimensional gel-based proteomics. A total of 1258 and 1109 Coomassie-stained spots were detected in the AL of representatives of the ABD and AB genomes. In two varieties (T aestivum Chinese Spring and T durum Bidi17), grown in two different years with full fungicide protection, no quantitative or qualitative (presence/absence) differences in spots were detected, suggesting that AL proteome is strongly genetically controlled. Comparison within and between species revealed a total of 339 AL significant protein spots. Among these spots, 30.8% differed within T. aestivum and 56.5% within T durum varieties, whereas only 12.7% differed between the two species.

They are routinely differentiated by serotyping, which is based on the antigenic variability at lipopolysaccharide moieties (O antigens), flagellar proteins (H1 and H2 antigens), and capsular polysaccharides (Vi antigens). The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for rapid screening and identification of epidemiologically important Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars based on specific sets of serovar-identifying biomarker ions. By analyzing 913 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains representing 89 different serovars using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, several potentially serovar-identifying biomarker ions were selected. Based on a combination of genus-, species-, subspecies-, and serovar-identifying biomarker ions, a decision tree classification algorithm was derived for the rapid identification of the five most frequently isolated Salmonella enterica serovars, Enteritidis, Typhimurium/4,[5], 12:i:-, Virchow, Infantis, and Hadar. Additionally, sets of potentially serovar-identifying biomarker ions were detected for other epidemiologically interesting serovars, such as Choleraesuis, Heidelberg, and Gallinarum. Furthermore, by using a bioinformatic approach, sequence variations corresponding to single or multiple amino acid exchanges in several biomarker proteins were tentatively assigned. The inclusivity and exclusivity of the specific sets of serovar-identifying biomarker ions for the top 5 serovars were almost 100%. This study shows that whole-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry can be a rapid method for prescreening S. enterica subsp. enterica isolates to identify epidemiologically important serovars and to reduce sample numbers that have to be subsequently analyzed using conventional serotyping by slide agglutination techniques.",English,Green Published,Article,

The combination of Raman spectroscopy (RS) with diverse machine learning methods has helped unravel the complexity of various microbiology problems. This approach offers a culture-free, rapid, and objective tool for identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this study, we employed the combinatorial approach of machine learning and RS to identify a novel spectral marker associated with phosphoethanolamine modification in the lipid A moiety of colistin-resistant Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The visible spectral fingerprints of this marker have been validated using partial least squares regression and discriminant analysis. The origin of the spectral feature was confirmed through hyperspectral imaging and K-means clustering of a single bacterial cell. The chemical structure of the modified lipid A moiety was verified by employing gold standard MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Mass spectrometry can characterize ancient colorants from these textiles, but its combination with separation techniques such as liquid chromatography requires the destruction of the pattern to extract organic dyes from the fabrics. In this study we applied mass spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) on colorful patterned textiles to show the spatial distribution of indigo-type and anthraquinone-type dyes. We evaluated different sample preparation techniques for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)-MS imaging, e.g. the production of imprints in TLC (thin layer chromatography) aluminum sheets and the embedding of the material in Technovit7100 to produce thin sections. Our protocol enabled the detection of indigo-type dyes directly on a historic textile of more than 2,000 years old embedded in Technovit7100.

Bacillus cultures were prepared under standardized conditions and inactivated according to a recently developed MS-compatible inactivation protocol for highly pathogenic microorganisms. MALDI-TOF MS was then employed to collect spectra from the microbial samples and to build up a database of bacterial reference spectra. This database comprised mass peak profiles of 374 strains from Bacillus and related genera, among them 102 strains of B. anthracis and 121 strains of B. cereus. The information contained in the database was investigated by means of visual inspection of gel view representations, univariate t tests for biomarker identification, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Analysis of gel views and independent t tests suggested B. anthracis- and B. cereus group-specific signals. For example, mass spectra of B. anthracis exhibited discriminating biomarkers at 4,606, 5,413, and 6,679 Da. A systematic search in proteomic databases allowed tentative assignment of some of the biomarkers to ribosomal protein or small acid-soluble proteins. Multivariate pattern analysis by unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis further revealed a subproteome-based taxonomy of the genus Bacillus. Superior classification accuracy was achieved when supervised ANNs were employed.

A novel prediction system using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been reported to be a perspective tool in European countries to identify patients who are likely to benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. In the present study, MALDI-TOF MS was used on pretreatment serum samples of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer to discriminate the spectra between disease control and disease progression groups in one cohort of Chinese patients. The candidate features for classification were subsequently validated in a blinded fashion in another set of patients. The correlation between plasma EGFR mutation status and the intensities of representative spectra for classification was evaluated. A total of 103 patients that were treated with EGFR-TKIs were included. It was determined that 8 polypeptides peaks were significant different between the disease control and disease progression group. A total of 6 polypeptides were established in the classification algorithm. The sensitivity of the algorithm to predict treatment responses was 76.2% (16/21) and the specificity was 81.8% (18/22).

The methodology is based on a newly developed machine learning framework called Venn machines. Is allows to output a valid probability interval. The methodology is designed for mass spectrometry data. For demonstrative purposes, we applied this methodology to MALDI-TOF data sets in order to predict the diagnosis of heart disease and early diagnoses of ovarian cancer and breast cancer. The experiments showed that probability intervals are narrow, that is, the output of the multiprobability predictor is similar to a single probability distribution. In addition, probability intervals produced for heart disease and ovarian cancer data were more accurate than the output of corresponding probability predictor. When Venn machines were forced to make point predictions, the accuracy of such predictions is for the most data better than the accuracy of the underlying algorithm that outputs single probability distribution of a label. Application of this methodology to MALDI-TOF data sets empirically demonstrates the validity. The accuracy of the proposed method on ovarian cancer data rises from 66.7 % 11 months in advance of the moment of diagnosis to up to 90.2 % at the moment of diagnosis. The same approach has been applied to heart disease data without time dependency, although the achieved accuracy was not as high (up to 69.9 %).

Methods: We undertook this pilot study using a combined application of magnetic beads with Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technique and ClinPro Tools v2.2 to detect 32 patients with HCC, 16 patients with chronic hepatitis (CH), 16 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 16 healthy volunteers. Results: The results showed 49, 33 and 37 differential peptide peaks respectively appeared in HCC, LC and CH groups. A Supervised Neural Network (SNN) algorithm was used to set up the classification model. Eleven of the identified peaks at m/z 5247.62, 7637.05, 1450.87, 4054.21, 1073.37, 3883.64, 5064.37, 4644.96, 5805.51, 1866.47 and 6579.6 were used to construct the peptides patterns. According to the model, we could clearly distinguish between HCC patients and healthy controls as well as between LC or CH patients and healthy controls.

In this work, we selected Ligands or Drug-target pairs (DTPs/nDTPs) of drugs with high affinity/non-affinity for different targets. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models become a very useful tool in this context to substantially reduce time and resources consuming experiments. Unfortunately most QSAR models predict activity against only one protein target and/or have not been implemented in the form of public web server freely accessible online to the scientific community. To solve this problem, we developed here a multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) classifier using the MARCH-INSIDE technique to calculate structural parameters of drug and target plus one Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) to seek the model. The best ANN model found is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with profile MLP 20:20-15-1:1. This MLP classifies correctly 611 out of 678 DTPs (sensitivity=90.12%) and 3083 out of 3408 nDTPs (specificity=90.46%), corresponding to training accuracy=90.41%. The validation of the model was carried out by means of external predicting series. The model classifies correctly 310 out of 338 DTPs (sensitivity=91.72%) and 1527 out of 1674 nDTP (specificity = 91.22%) in validation series, corresponding to total accuracy = 91.30% for validation series (predictability). This model favorably compares with other ANN models developed in this work and Machine Learning classifiers published before to address the same problem in different aspects. We implemented the present model at web portal Bio-AIMS in the form of an online server called: Non-Linear MARCH-INSIDE Nested Drug-Bank Exploration & Screening Tool (NL MIND-BEST), which is located at URL: http://miaja.tic.udc.es/Bio-AIMS/NL-MIND-BEST.php.

The major computational obstacle in finding such patterns is the large number of mass/charge peaks (features, biomarkers, data points) in a spectrum. To tackle this problem, we have developed methods for data preprocessing and biomarker selection. The preprocessing consists of binning, baseline correction, and normalization. An algorithm, extended Markov blanket, is developed for biomarker detection, which combines redundant feature removal and discriminant feature selection. The biomarker selection couples with support vector machine to achieve sample prediction from high-resolution proteomic profiles.

We analyzed adherence to the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) candidiasis guidelines and the reasons for guideline nonadherence. We also investigated whether matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) improved time to effective antifungal therapy compared with historical data (median, 43.2 hours). Methods Cancer patients with candidemia between 1/1/17 and 12/31/19 were included. Adherence to 7 individual IDSA guideline components was assessed. Composite IDSA guideline adherence (defined as meeting >= 6 guideline components) was also assessed. Charts were reviewed to examine reasons for noncompliance. Results Of 157 patients with candidemia, 150 (95.5%) had infectious disease (ID) consultation. The median total time from blood culture collection to antifungal initiation was 42.1 hours. Excluding 39 patients with short treatment due to death, there was 100% adherence with surveillance blood cultures, followed by antifungal susceptibility testing (117/118, 99.2%), initial appropriate therapy (117/118, 99.2%), antifungal duration (110/118, 93.2%), line removal (82/91, 90.1%), eye exams (93/118, 78.8%), and step-down therapy (69/94, 73.4%). A quarter (30/118) did not meet composite IDSA guideline adherence. Univariate logistic regression suggested a relationship between poor cancer prognosis and incomplete adherence to the 2016 IDSA candidiasis guidelines (odds ratio, 8.6; 95% CI, 1.6-47). Conclusions The addition of MALDI-TOF did not shorten time to effective antifungal therapy. Nearly all patients were seen by ID for candidemia.

For a test sample, two class labels that are predicted in both schemes are compared. If two class labels are the same, we assign the test sample to an identical label; otherwise, only for samples belonging to different classes predicted from two schemes, a retraining method is employed.

To do so, a fast and simple technique was used based on Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis combined with a statistical correlation treatment of the spectra in comparison with a standard spectrum of Gramicidin A (GR -A) and Gramicidin S (GR -S). The correlation analysis employed made it possible to obtain a similarity index using Pearson (P P ) and Spearman (P S ) coefficients for pairs of FTIR transmittance spectra, associated to different fermentation conditions. More favorable P P and P S similarity indices were obtained for pairs with GR -S rather than GR -A when compared with the samples under evaluation, observing that production of GR -S was promoted under high concentration of CKS (400 g/L) with similarity index of 0.752 and 0.813 for P P and P S , respectively, considering the FTIR spectra between 400 and 4000 cm -1 , whereas low concentration of CKS (100 g/L) provided non favorable correlation factors (P P similarity indices lower than 0.4). The same behavior was observed when the study was considered between 1450 and 1750 cm -1 corresponding with the interval absorbance of amide I, amide II, and ammonium dominate bands in GR -S. Finally, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) corroborated this correlation study, proving that FTIR could be an interesting tool for establishing the optimal conditions of biotechnological processes.",English,hybrid,Article,Gramicidin; Antibiotic; FTIR; Data correlation; Box behnken

In practice, pooling of samples is often used to save money, but the influence on diagnostic accuracy has not been described for M. bovis. Therefore, a convenience sample of 17 pooled samples containing 5 individual BALf samples per farm was analyzed as well. The results for the pooled samples were compared with those for the individual samples to determine sensitivity and specificity.

However, currently available bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., dot products) do not work well with glycolipid mass spectra such as those produced by lipid A, the membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide. To address this issue, we propose a spectral library approach coupled with a machine learning technique to more accurately identify microbes. Here, we demonstrate the performance of the model-based spectral library approach for microbial identification using approximately a thousand mass spectra collected from multi-drug-resistant bacteria. At false discovery rates < 1%, our approach identified many more bacterial species than the existing approaches such as the Bruker Biotyper and characterized over 97% of their phenotypes accurately. As the diversity in our glycolipid mass spectral library increases, we anticipate that it will provide valuable information to more rapidly treat infected patients.",English,Green Accepted,Article,

Ideally, with such labeling technique, a mass shift of 4 Da of the isotopic distributions of peptides from the labeled sample is induced, which allows one to distinguish the two samples and to quantify the relative abundance of the peptides. It is worth noting, however, that the presence of small quantities of O-16 and O-17 atoms during the labeling step can cause incomplete labeling. In practice, ignoring incomplete labeling may result in the biased estimation of the relative abundance of the peptide in the compared samples. A Markov model was developed to address this issue (Zhu, Valkenborg, Burzykowski. J. Proteome Res. 9, 2669-2677, 2010). The model assumed that the peak intensities were normally distributed with heteroscedasticity using a power-of-the-mean variance funtion. Such a dependence has been observed in practice. Alternatively, we formulate the model within the Bayesian framework. This opens the possibility to further extend the model by the inclusion of random effects that can be used to capture the biological/technical variability of the peptide abundance.

Malignant meningiomas are associated with less than 2 years median survival. The inability to predict recurrence and progression of meningiomas induces significant anxiety for patients and limits physicians in implementing prophylactic treatment approaches. This report presents an analytical approach to tissue characterization based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) which is introduced in an attempt to develop a reference database for predictive classification of brain tumors. This pilot study was designed to evaluate the potential of such an approach and to begin to address limitations of the current methodology. Five recurrent and progressive meningiomas for which surgical specimens were available from the original and progressed grades were selected and tested against nonprogressive high-grade meningiomas, high-grade gliomas, and nontumor brain specimens. The common profiling approach of data acquisition was compared to imaging and revealed significant benefits in spatially resolved acquisition for improved spectral definition. A preliminary classifier based on the support vector machine showed the ability to distinguish meningioma image spectra from the nontumor brain and from gliomas, a different type of brain tumor, and to enable class imaging of surgical tissue. Although the development of classifiers was shown to be sensitive to data preparation parameters such as recalibration and peak picking criteria, it also suggested the potential for maturing into a predictive algorithm if provided with a larger series of well-defined cases.",English,Green Accepted,Article,

Glycosylation is a common and complex posttranslational modification of proteins that affects their structure and activity. We compared plasma N-glycosylation profiles between patients with CD or UC and healthy individuals (controls). METHODS: We analyzed the total plasma N-glycomes of 2635 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and 996 controls by mass spectrometry with a linkage-specific sialic acid derivatization technique. Plasma samples were acquired from 2 hospitals in Italy (discovery cohort, 1989 patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and 570 controls) and 1 medical center in the United States (validation cohort, 646 cases of IBD and 426 controls). Sixty-three glycoforms met our criteria for relative quantification and were extracted from the raw data with the software MassyTools. Common features shared by the glycan compositions were combined in 78 derived traits, including the number of antennae of complex-type glycans and levels of fucosylation, bisection, galactosylation, and sialylation. Associations of plasma N-glycomes with age, sex, CD, UC, and IBD-related parameters such as disease location, surgery and medication, level of C-reactive protein, and sedimentation rate were tested by linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Plasma samples from patients with IBD had a higher abundance of large-size glycans compared with controls, a decreased relative abundance of hybrid and high-mannose structures, lower fucosylation, lower galactosylation, and higher sialylation (alpha 2,3-and alpha 2,6-linked). We could discriminate plasma from patients with CD from that of patients with UC based on higher bisection, lower galactosylation, and higher sialylation (alpha 2,3-linked). Glycosylation patterns were associated with disease location and progression, the need for a more potent medication, and surgery. These results were replicated in a large independent cohort.

To focus on the changes that occur at the point of connection between the neural network cells, synaptosomal preparations from post-mortem human brain of six chronic alcoholics and six non-alcoholic controls were compared using 2-D differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Functionally affected and spared regions (superior frontal gyrus, SFG, and occipital cortex, OC, respectively) were analyzed from both groups to further investigate the specific pathological response that alcoholism has on the brain. Forty-nine proteins were differentially regulated between the SFG of alcoholics and the SFG of controls and 94 proteins were regulated in the OC with an overlap of 23 proteins. Additionally, the SFG was compared to the OC within each group (alcoholics or controls) to identify region-specific differences. A selection was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealing proteins involved in vesicle transport, metabolism, folding and trafficking, and signal transduction, all of which have the potential to influence synaptic activity. A number of proteins identified in this study have been previously related to alcoholism; however, the focus on synaptic proteins has also uncovered novel alcoholism-affected proteins. Further exploration of these proteins will illuminate the mechanisms altering synaptic plasticity, and thus neuronal signaling and response, in the alcoholic brain.",English,"Green Published, Green Accepted",Article,Human brain; OC; SFG; Synapse

This retrospective study aimed to uncover drug resistance of pathogens and the GNBI effect on in-hospital death and distinguish death risk factors in a medical intensive care unit (ICU). Patients and Methods: A retrospective study of all GNBI patients in the medical ICU of the Third Xiangya Hospital over 9 nine years was conducted. Blood samples were performed by a BACTEC 9240 system, MALDI-TOF MS, Bruker and Vitek-2 system. Logistic regression was used for analyzing risk factors for death. Results: Seventy-five episodes of GNBI developed in 68 (1.4%) out of 4954 patients over a span of 9 years. The most frequently isolated bacterium was Klebsiella pneumoniae, with the lungs as the predominant source of GNBI. The resistance rate of Gramnegative bacteria to polymyxin B was 11.6% after excluding those intrinsically resistant non-fermentative bacteria. All Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam. Thirty-three (48.5%) patients underwent inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment and 48 (70.6%) patients died during the hospitalization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that lymphocyte count at GNBI onset <= 0.5x109/L, invasive mechanical ventilation, and septic shock were related to in-hospital death. Body mass index >= 23 and appropriate empirical antibiotic use after GNBI were negatively associated with in-hospital death. Conclusion: GNBI was a frequent complication among patients in the medical ICU.

10.1186/1471-2105-11-490,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,2010,BPDA - A Bayesian peptide detection algorithm for mass spectrometry,"Sun, YT","Background: Mass spectrometry (MS) is an essential analytical tool in proteomics. Many existing algorithms for peptide detection are based on isotope template matching and usually work at different charge states separately, making them ineffective to detect overlapping peptides and low abundance peptides. Results: We present BPDA, a Bayesian approach for peptide detection in data produced by MS instruments with high enough resolution to baseline-resolve isotopic peaks, such as MALDI-TOF and LC-MS. We model the spectra as a mixture of candidate peptide signals, and the model is parameterized by MS physical properties. BPDA is based on a rigorous statistical framework and avoids problems, such as voting and ad-hoc thresholding, generally encountered in algorithms based on template matching. It systematically evaluates all possible combinations of possible peptide candidates to interpret a given spectrum, and iteratively finds the best fitting peptide signal in order to minimize the mean squared error of the inferred spectrum to the observed spectrum. In contrast to previous detection methods, BPDA performs deisotoping and deconvolution of mass spectra simultaneously, which enables better identification of weak peptide signals and produces higher sensitivities and more robust results. Unlike template-matching algorithms, BPDA can handle complex data where features overlap. Our experimental results indicate that BPDA performs well on simulated data and real MS data sets, for various resolutions and signal to noise ratios, and compares very favorably with commonly used commercial and open-source software, such as flexAnalysis, OpenMS, and Decon2LS, according to sensitivity and detection accuracy. Conclusion: Unlike previous detection methods, which only employ isotopic distributions and work at each single charge state alone, BPDA takes into account the charge state distribution as well, thus lending information to better identify weak peptide signals and produce more robust results. The proposed approach is based on a rigorous statistical framework, which avoids problems generally encountered in algorithms based on template matching. Our experiments indicate that BPDA performs well on both simulated data and real data, and compares very favorably with commonly used commercial and open-source software.

We have evaluated the potential value of this approach to classify various clinico-pathological features in colorectal cancer by employing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Methods: Protein extracts from 31 tumour and 33 normal mucosa specimens were purified, subjected to MALDI-Tof MS and then analysed using the 'GenePattern' suite of computational tools (Broad Institute, MIT, USA). Comparative Gene Marker Selection with either a t-test or a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) test statistic was used to identify and rank differentially expressed marker peaks. The k-nearest neighbours algorithm was used to build classification models either using separate training and test datasets or else by using an iterative, 'leave-one-out' cross-validation method. Results: 73 protein peaks in the mass range 1800-16000Da were differentially expressed in tumour verses adjacent normal mucosa tissue (P <= 0.01, false discovery rate <= 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis classified most tumour and normal mucosa into distinct cluster groups. Supervised prediction correctly classified the tumour/normal mucosa status of specimens in an independent test spectra dataset with 100% sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval: 67.9-99.2%). Supervised prediction using 'leave-one-out' cross validation algorithms for tumour spectra correctly classified 10/13 poorly differentiated and 16/18 well/moderately differentiated tumours (P = < 0.001; receiver-operator characteristics - ROC - error, 0.171); disease recurrence was correctly predicted in 5/6 cases and disease-free survival (median follow-up time, 25 months) was correctly predicted in 22/23 cases (P = < 0.001; ROC error, 0.105). A similar analysis of normal mucosa spectra correctly predicted 11/14 patients with, and 15/19 patients without lymph node involvement (P = 0.001; ROC error, 0.212). Conclusions: Protein expression profiling of surgically resected CRC tissue extracts by MALDI-TOF MS has potential value in studies aimed at improved molecular classification of this disease. Further studies, with longer follow-up times and larger patient cohorts, that would permit independent validation of supervised classification models, would be required to confirm the predictive value of tumour spectra for disease recurrence/patient survival.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,

We have isolated chromosomal linker histones from developing maize kernels before (11 days after pollination, dap) and after (16 dap) initiation of storage synthesis. Six linker histone gene products were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A marked shift of around 4 pH units was observed for the linker histone spot pattern after 2D-gel electrophoresis when comparing the proteins of 11 and 16 dap kernels. The shift from acidic to more basic protein forms suggests a reduction in the level of post-translational modifications of linker histones during kernel development. Analysis of their DNA-binding affinity revealed that the different linker histone gene products bind double-stranded DNA with similar affinity. Interestingly, the linker histones isolated from 16 dap kernels consistently displayed a lower affinity for DNA than the proteins isolated from 11 dap kernels. These findings suggest that the affinity for DNA of the linker histones may be regulated by post-translational modification and that the reduction in DNA affinity could be involved in a more open chromatin during storage synthesis.",English,,Article,Chromatin; DNA interaction; H1; Linker histone; 2D-gel electrophoresis

However, the extent of inter-individual heterogeneity and the mechanisms underlying such heterogeneity beyond antibody or complement systems have not been well studied.Methods The plasma bactericidal activity of five healthy volunteers were tested against 30 strains of Gram-negative uropathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, associated with bloodstream infections. IgG and IgM titers specific to K. pneumoniae strains KP13883 and KPB1 were measured by ELISA, and complement inhibitor was used to measure the contribution of complement-induced killing. Furthermore, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was conducted to determine the metabolomic components of plasma with bactericidal properties in 25 healthy individuals using Bayesian inference of Pearson correlation between peak intensity and colony counts of surviving bacteria.Results Plasma bactericidal activity varied widely between individuals against various bacterial strains. While individual plasma with higher IgM titers specific to K. pneumoniae strain KP13883 showed more efficient killing of the strain, both IgM and IgG titers for K. pneumoniae strain KPB1 did not correlate well with the killing activity. Complement inhibition assays elucidated that the complement-mediated killing was not responsible for the inter-individual heterogeneity in either isolate. Subsequently, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on plasmas of 25 healthy individuals, we identified several small molecules including gangliosides, pediocins, or saponins as candidates that showed negative correlation between peak intensities and colony forming units of the test bacteria.Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate the inter-individual heterogeneity of constitutive innate humoral bactericidal function quantitatively and that the heterogeneity can be independent of antibody or the complement system.",English,gold,Article,"humoral bactericidal activity; plasma antibacterial activity;

As antibiotic resistance rates continue to grow at an alarming speed, the current study was undertaken to assess the impact of this intervention in a challenging patient population with bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Methods: A total of 153 patients with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia hospitalized prior to the study intervention were compared to 112 patients treated post-implementation. Outcomes assessed included time to optimal antibiotic therapy, time to active treatment when inactive, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, all-cause 30-day mortality, and total hospital expenditures. Results: Integrating rapid diagnostics with antimicrobial stewardship improved time to optimal antibiotic therapy (80.9 h in the pre-intervention period versus 23.2 h in the intervention period, P < 0.001) and effective antibiotic therapy (89.7 h versus 32 h, P < 0.001). Patients in the pre-intervention period had increased duration of hospitalization compared to those in the intervention period (23.3 days versus 15.3 days, P = 0.0001) and longer intensive care unit length of stay (16 days versus 10.7 days, P = 0.008). Mortality among patients during the intervention period was lower (21% versus 8.9%, P = 0.01) and our study intervention remained a significant predictor of survival (OR, 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.79) after multivariate logistic regression. Mean hospital costs for each inpatient survivor were reduced $26,298 in the intervention cohort resulting in an estimated annual cost savings of $2.4 million (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Integration of rapid identification and susceptibility techniques with antimicrobial stewardship resulted in significant improvements in clinical and financial outcomes for patients with bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negatives.

Mastitis is predominantly caused by bacterial infections. The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of bacterial culture and the VetMAXTM MastiType Multi Kit PCR in identified clinical mastitis pathogens. A total of 396 quarter-level milk samples were collected from 396 cows with clinical mastitis on 29 farms in the subtropical dairy region of Australia between March and December 2021. These samples were cultured and tested by PCR, and analysed using Bayesian latent class analysis under the assumption of one population two tests and also of three populations two tests, by dividing the population into subpopulations based on regions. Informative priors used in the analysis were calculated from published evidence. Models were compared using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of changes in priors. The most common isolates cultured and detected by PCR were Streptococcus uberis (17.4% and 27.3%, respectively) and Escherichia coli (12.6% and 25.0%, respectively). Under the assumption of one population two tests, the Se of PCR (at cycle threshold (Ct) <= 37) was higher than that of bacterial culture for both pathogens: for E. coli, the Se was 50.2 % (95% posterior probability interval (PPI): 37.4; 74.1) for bacterial culture, and 93.7% (95% PPI: 85.5; 98.4) for PCR. For S. uberis, the Se was 50.4% (95% PPI: 40.9; 61.3) for bacterial culture, and 81.5% (73.0; 88.9) for PCR. Conversely, the Sp of bacterial culture was higher than that of PCR for both pathogens: for E. coli, the Sp was 99.2% (97.8; 100) for bacterial culture, and 95.1 % (87.8; 99.4) for PCR. For S. uberis, the Sp was 99.2% (95% PPI: 97.6; 100) for bacterial culture, and 96.7% (95% PPI: 92.1; 99.2) for PCR. Bayesian latent class analysis with three populations two tests was only performed for S. uberis. For E. coli, this could not be performed because there were no PCR-positive results in one subpopulation. Under the assumption of three populations two tests, for S. uberis, the Se was 49.6% (40.6; 59.4) for bacterial culture, and 81.1% (72.6; 88.6) for PCR; and the Sp for bacterial culture was 99.1 % (97.7; 100), and for PCR was 96.9% (93.0; 99.3). The DIC for the one population two tests model was lower than the DIC for the three populations two tests model. The sensitivity analysis for the one population two tests model demonstrated that a 10% reduction in priors led to substantial changes in Se of both bacterial culture and PCR tests for E. coli and S. uberis, with overlap percentages ranging from 80.6% to 92.2%. In contrast, the Sp of bacterial culture and PCR tests remained relatively stable despite changes in priors, except for the Sp of PCR test for E. coli. In summary, the VetMAXTM MastiType Multi Kit demonstrated higher Se compared to bacterial culture, suggesting its potential as a routine test for identifying mastitis pathogens in milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis. While the bacterial culture method offered higher Sp in pathogen detection; results obtained following bacterial culture and subsequent susceptibility testing remain valuable, particularly in guiding antimicrobial treatment for mastitis.",English,hybrid,Article,"Intra-mammary infections; Quarter-level milk samples; MALDI-TOF-MS; DNA

PCDH1 is located on chromosome 5q31-33, in the vicinity of several known candidate genes for asthma and allergy. To exclude that the associations observed for PCDH1 originate from the nearby cytokine cluster, an extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed. Effects of polymorphisms in PCDH1 on asthma, BHR, and related phenotypes were studied comprehensively. Methods: Genotype information was acquired from Illumina HumanHap300Chip genotyping, MALDI-TOF MS genotyping, and imputation. LD was assessed by Haploview 4.2 software. Associations were investigated in a population of 1454 individuals (763 asthmatics) from two German study populations [MAGICS and International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood phase II (ISAAC II)] using logistic regression to model additive effects. Results: No relevant LD between PCDH1 tagging polymorphisms and 98 single nucleotide polymorphisms within the cytokine cluster was detected.

We have developed a method for MALDI TOF-TOF instrumentation that uses peptide masses and their measurement errors to confirm protein identifications from a first pass MS/MS database search. The method uses MS1-level spectral data that have heretofore been ignored by most search engines. This approach uses the distribution of mass errors of peptide matches in the MS1 spectrum to develop a probability model that is independent of the MS/MS database search identifications. Peptide mass matches can come from both precursor ions that have been fragmented as well as those that are tentatively identified by accurate mass alone. This additional corroboration enables us to confirm protein identifications to MS/MS-based scores that are otherwise considered to be only of moderate quality. Straightforward and easily applicable to current proteomic analyses, this tool termed ""Protein-Processor"" provides a robust and invaluable addition to current protein identification tools.",English,Green Accepted,Article,"Bayesian analysis; Bioinformatics; Protein sequencing; MALDI; Tandem

10.1159/000139657,CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES,2008,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of MMP-2 gene in stroke subtypes,"Fatar, M","Background: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are expressed after ischemic stroke. These proteases are responsible for a higher incidence of hemorrhages, are correlated to size of infarction and influence the effects of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment. We therefore evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of MMP-2 in different subtypes of stroke patients in an association study using a case-control design. Methods: 197 stroke patients were divided according to modified TOAST criteria (small vessel disease, large vessel disease, hemorrhagic stroke and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis) and compared to 143 controls. Clinical data like age, sex, risk factors and diagnostic results including MRI or cranial CT scans and ultrasound evaluations of intra-and extracranial arteries were obtained. Genotypes of MMP-2 (12 SNP) were compared to controls and DNA samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed for small vessel disease to test for interactions between markers and defined clinical risk factors. Additionally, MMP-2 serum levels obtained in the first 24 h after stroke were measured. Results: From the MMP-2 gene, 5 markers (rs1030868, rs2241145, rs2287074, rs2287076, rs7201) showed a significant association with small vessel infarcts (p < 0.05) and rs7201: g. C was identified as an independent risk factor by multivariable logistic regression analysis. MMP-2 protein levels were significantly lower in this group (174 8 48 ng/dl) versus controls (214 8 56 ng/dl). For other stroke subtypes, no significant association with MMP-2 SNP could be found. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates an association of the MMP-2 gene with the development of lacunar stroke, and no association of MMP-2 with other stroke subtypes. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

Noninvasive and convenient biomarkers for diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) as early as possible remain an urgent need. The aim of this study was to discover and identify potential protein biomarkers for PTC specifically. Methods: Two hundred and twenty four (224) serum samples with 108 PTC and 116 controls were randomly divided into a training set and a blind testing set. Serum proteomic profiles were analyzed using SELDI-TOF-MS. Candidate biomarkers were purified by HPLC, identified by LC-MS/MS and validated using ProteinChip immunoassays. Results: A total of 3 peaks (m/z with 9190, 6631 and 8697 Da) were screened out by support vector machine (SVM) to construct the classification model with high discriminatory power in the training set. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 95.15% and 93.97% respectively in the blind testing set. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 9190 Da was found to be up-regulated in PTC patients, and was identified as haptoglobin alpha-1 chain. Another two candidate biomarkers (6631, 8697 Da) were found down-regulated in PTC and identified as apolipoprotein C-I and apolipoprotein C-III, respectively. In addition, the level of haptoglobin alpha-1 chain (9190 Da) progressively increased with the clinical stage I, II, III and IV, and the expression of apolipoprotein C-I and apolipoprotein C-III (6631, 8697 Da) gradually decreased in higher stages. Conclusion: We have identified a set of biomarkers that could discriminate PTC from non-cancer controls. An efficient strategy, including SELDI-TOF-MS analysis, HPLC purification, MALDI-TOF-MS trace and LC-MS/MS identification, has been proved successful.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,

Recently, two genome-wide association studies have identified three variants in CLU gene encoding clusterin associated with AD risk in Caucasians, while there are no studies on the association of CLU with AD risk in Asians. Methods: The study investigated 324 sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) and 388 healthy controls matched for sex and age in a Han Chinese population. Three common genetic variants (rs2279590, rs11136000 and rs9331888) in CLU gene were genotyped using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Results: The minor allele (G) of the rs9331888 polymorphism within CLU was significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD (OR = 1.39.95% Cl = 1.13-1.72, P=0.002). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the rs9331888 polymorphism presented strong associations with LOAD in the dominant, recessive and additive models. No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of the rs2279590 and rs11136000 polymorphisms were found between LOAD patients and controls. Haplotype analysis identified a risk haplotype (CCG) (OR= 1.66) and a protective haplotype (CCC)(OR = 0.70). Conclusions: Our findings implicate CLU as a susceptibility gene for LOAD in Han Chinese.

Previous studies have indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with different levels of serum lipid. Therefore, this study explored the relationship between the APOA1/C3/A4/A5-ZPR1-BUD13 gene cluster gene polymorphisms and dyslipidemia in the total sample population and stratified by genders in a northeast Chinese population. Methods: A total of 3,850 participants from Jilin Province, China, were enrolled in our study, and their serum lipid levels were measured. Six functional SNPs (APOA1 rs5072, APOC3 rs5128, APOA4 rs5104, APOA5 rs651821, ZPR1 rs2075294 and BUD13 rs10488698) were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and MALDI-TOF-MS. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship of APOA1/C3/A4/A5-ZPR1-BUD13 gene cluster gene polymorphisms with dyslipidemia. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses were performed with the SNPStats program and Haploview software. Results: All SNPs conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Logistic regression analysis revealed that rs5072, rs5128 and rs651821 were associated with hypertriglyceridemia, rs5104 and rs651821 were associated with low-HDL cholesterolemia in overall group. rs651821 was associated with hypertriglyceridemia and low-HDL cholesterolemia in both the male and female group. However, among females, rs5072 was observed to be associated with hypertriglyceridemia.

Different schemes of source identification were tested: use of the complete or filtered reference library; characterization of the isolates by genotypic or proteomic profiling based on ERIC-PCR or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, respectively; isolate by isolate assignment using either classifiers based on the Pearson similarity or SVM (support vector machine). With the exception of one source identification scheme, which was discarded since it used self-assignment, all tested schemes resulted in low rates of correct classification (<35%) and significant rates of incorrect classification (>15%). The heterogeneous coverage of E. coli genotypic diversity between sources and the uneven distribution of E. coli genotypes in the library likely explain the difficulties encountered in identifying the sources of fecal contamination. Shannon diversity index of sources ranged from 0 for several wildlife species sampled once to 3.03 for sewage treatment plant effluents sampled on various occasions, showing discrepancies between sources. The uneven genotypic composition of the library was attested by the value of the Pielou index (0.54), the high proportion of nondiscriminatory genotypes (>91% of the isolates), and the very low proportion of discriminatory genotypes (<3%). Since efforts made to constitute such a library are not affordable for routine analyses, the results question the relevance of developing such a method for identifying sources of fecal contamination on such a coastline.",English,,Article,recreational waters; bathing water quality; fecal indicators; E. coli

Several studies have suggested that protein associated with CFG could be partly responsible for its excellent emulsifying properties in oil-in-water emulsion systems. Nevertheless, the composition and identity of the protein component has never been determined. In the present study, CFG was deglycosylated by treating with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and the resulting proteins were purified by passage through C18 solid phase extraction cartridges. The proteins were then separated and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein band from the gel was treated with a proteolyticenzyme, chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were cleaned using C18 Zip Tip pipet tips and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with automated tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The partial sequences derived from the mass spectrometry analyses of the resulting chymotryptic peptides were found to be similar to the 22-kDa alpha-zein Z1 (az22z1) protein (a major storage protein in corn endosperm) when queried against the primary sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.

However, the transition from discovery to adoption of proteomic tests has proved challenging. Slow adoption of these tests in clinical practice is, in part, related to insufficient understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying multivariate tests developed based on correlative studies. While identification of individual proteins may provide important insights, elucidation of concerted relationships of sets of proteins with biological pathways can better reflect complex phenomena, such as cancerogenesis and response to treatment. Protein set enrichment analysis (PSEA) allows identification of associations of mass spectral features or test classifications with biological function by looking for consistent correlations across a group of proteins. We evaluated the utility of PSEA for exploring the biological information content of mass spectra, using a sample set with mass spectral data and matched protein expression information. This made it possible to detect significant biological associations with mass spectral peaks without identifying their protein constituents. We demonstrated that the method produces reproducible associations and can be used for elucidation of the mechanisms of action associated with two previously developed multivariate mass spectrometry-based tests. Significant correlations with several host immune response-related processes were found on the level of individual mass spectral features and with test classifications. The results illustrate the utility of the PSEA approach applied to mass spectral data as a method for elucidating biological mechanisms underlying phenotypes related to different physiological states of the organism.

10.1002/pmic.200900248,PROTEOMICS,2009,Spectral clustering in peptidomics studies helps to unravel modification profile of biologically active peptides and enhances peptide identification rate,"Menschaert, G","When studying the set of biologically active peptides (the so-called peptidome) of a cell type, organ, or entire organism, the identification of peptides is mostly attempted by MS. However, identification rates are often dismally unsatisfactory. A great deal of failed or missed identifications may be attributable to the wealth of modifications on peptides, some of which may originate from in vivo post-translational processes to activate the molecule, whereas others could be introduced during the tissue preparation procedures. Preliminary knowledge of the modification profile of specific peptidome samples would greatly improve identification rates. To this end we developed an approach that performs clustering of mass spectra in a way that allows us to group spectra having similar peak patterns over significant segments. Comparing members of one spectral group enables us to assess the modifications (expressed as mass shifts in Dalton) present in a peptidome sample. The clustering algorithm in this study is called Bonanza, and it was applied to MALDI-TOF/TOF MS spectra from the mouse. Peptide identification rates went up from 17 to 36% for 278 spectra obtained from the pancreatic islets and from 21 to 43% for 163 pituitary spectra. Spectral clustering with subsequent advanced database search may result in the discovery of new biologically active peptides and modifications thereof, as shown by this report indeed.",English,,Article,Animal proteomics; Peptidomics; PTM; Spectral clustering

They must therefore give way to bioremediation techniques which are less costly and result in ecofriendly products. The aim of the study was to assess the suitability of PCB degrading bacteria (using published data) from their environmental matrix for use in environmental bioremediation. Initial isolation of the bacteria was obtained by culturing ash samples taken from the combustion chamber of an MP400 Incinerator of infectious waste at Komfo Anokye Teaching hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana, and composite soil samples taken from a transformer-servicing site at an electricity substation in Sunyani, Ghana. Test for thermotolerance was carried out by the culturing of bacteria from the soil samples and exposing them to higher temperatures (55 degrees C and 65 degrees C) to assess their resilience in an incubator for 48 h. Growing cultures were sub-cultured, after which a cocktail of bacteria isolate characterization assays was carried out on the growing isolates. These included biochemical tests on the bacterial suspensions using the analytical profile index (API 20E) for examining Enterobacteriaceae and other non-fastidious bacteria. This was followed by MALDI-ToF-MS analyses of the bacterial strains to profile and image their proteins. A molecular step was needed which was the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, using specific primer pairs, to amplify and accentuate sections of the bacterial DNA extracts. Results of the study showed a confirmed sample site in Ghana for harvesting bacteria capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). MALDI-ToF-MS analyses revealed the possible species as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. The conventional PCR and gel electrophoresis steps confirmed the presence of bph genes encoding the 2,3-dioxygenase enzymes in bacteria with PCB-degrading ability as documented in published data. The serial dilution of the bacterial suspensions was modified from 10-7 to 10-5 which was enough for distinct colonies to be counted, and it was a novel contribution to environmental microbiology. The confirmation of Pseudomonas and Bacillus species isolated from a transformer oil-impacted soil in this study shows promise in growing these strains in various environmental media such as in a gaseous medium to mineralize gas -phase PCBs from combustion smoke or in bottom ash residues to degrade solidphase PCBs. It can also be applied in bioremediation of waste liquid systems containing PCBs.",English,gold,Article,"Environmental bioremediation; PCB-degrading bacteria; Bacterial isolate

Proteins were extracted from frozen tissues originating from 91 sporadic PTCs and 86 post-Chernobyl PTCs. Proteins were separated get-electrophoretically, gels were silver stained, spots scanned and their intensity quantified. After excision of spots from the gel and protein digestion, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed followed by correlation of these results to human proteins using appropriate software and database. After this screening approach, altogether 20 candidate proteins were selected and measured semiquantitatively (Remmele score) using immunohistochemistry. Logistic regression modeling was performed for discriminating the groups. NTRK1, metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-9 and MMP-13) and Cathepsins (-W and -X) proved to be of highest significance for discriminating the groups irrespective of the regression model utilized. When considering age and gender, each of 3 proteins by itself made possible a complete separation of the groups otherwise a combination of 2 of the 5 proteins mentioned was needed. In conclusion, abundance of proteins known to be associated with a more aggressive tumor type (MMPs and Cathepsins) appeared increased in post-Chernobyl PTC compared to sporadic PTC, thus underlining the known aggressiveness of radiation-associated PTC.

Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the minor allele of rs4149601(A = 20.9%) was associated with a 2.60 kg, 2.78 cm and 0.97 kg/m(2) decrease per allele copy in weight, waist and BMI, respectively. Carriers of this allele also had a significant lower risk of overweight/obesity (p < 0.0001, OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.74) as compared to non-carriers. However, no significant association between genotypes at rs2288774 and rs3865418 and covariate-adjusted overweight/obesity or any related phenotypes was observed. These results suggested that the functional variant of NEDD4L, rs4149601, may be associated with obesity and related phenotypes, and further genetic and functional studies are required to understand its role in the manifestation of obesity.",English,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",Article,NEDD4L; genetic diversity; obesity
10.3390/toxins7051808,TOXINS,2015,Influence of Honeybee Sting on Peptidome Profile in Human Serum,"Matysiak, J","The aim of this study was to explore the serum peptide profiles from honeybee stung and non-stung individuals. Two groups of serum samples obtained from 27 beekeepers were included in our study. The first group of samples was collected within 3 h after a bee sting (stung beekeepers), and the samples were collected from the same person a second time after at least six weeks after the last bee sting (non-stung beekeepers). Peptide profile spectra were determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry combined with Omix, ZipTips and magnetic beads based on weak-cation exchange (MB-WCX) enrichment strategies in the mass range of 1-10 kDa. The samples were classified, and discriminative models were established by using the quick classifier, genetic algorithm and supervised neural network algorithms. All of the statistical algorithms used in this study allow distinguishing analyzed groups with high statistical significance, which confirms the influence of honeybee sting on the serum peptidome profile. The results of this study may broaden the understanding of the human organism's response to honeybee venom. Due to the fact that our pilot study was carried out on relatively small datasets, it is necessary to conduct further proteomic research of the response to honeybee sting on a larger group of samples.",English,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",Article,

Cows (n = 432) were randomly selected from seven U.S. dairy herds already participating in a multi-site clinical trial in summer 2018. Aseptic foremilk samples were collected from quarters (n = 1728) two days prior to dry-off, and subjected to index and reference tests. The four index tests included rapid culture, a predictive algorithm, an esterase strip test measuring somatic cell count (SCC) and a cow-side lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test. Rapid culture was performed by inoculating quarter milk samples onto a commercial rapid culture plate. Plates were evaluated by technicians after 30 40 h of incubation at 37 2 C. Quarters were classified as infected if any bacterial growth was observed. For the algorithm test method, all quarters were classified as infected if the cow met any of the following criteria: 1) any Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) test with a SCC > 200,000 cells / ml during the current lactation or 2) two or more clinical mastitis cases during the current lactation. Esterase-SCC and cow-side LDH tests involved adding milk to the test strip and reading for color changes. For esterase-SCC and cow-side LDH tests, low (250 cells / ml and 100 U / L) and high (500 cells / ml and 200 U / L) thresholds were used to classify quarters as infected or not. Composite samples (4 x 2 mL quarter-milk samples commingled) were also tested for rapid culture, esterase-SCC and cow-side LDH tests, such that if a composite sample was positive, then all quarters contributing to that sample were classified as infected. The reference test was traditional aerobic culture conducted in an accredited laboratory using MALDI-ToF for identification of isolates. Traditional culture was only conducted on quarter-milk samples, and consequently, IMI was always considered at the quarter-level. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), apparent prevalence, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for each index test. Cohen's Kappa (kappa) was used to measure agreement between tests. Algorithm, esterase-SCC and cow-side LDH tests had poor agreement with the reference test (kappa ranging from 0.01 to 0.12), while rapid culture had fair agreement (kappa = 0.28). No test had concurrently high SE and SP. Negative predictive values were moderate to high for all tests.",English,Bronze,Article,"Intramammary infection; Algorithm; On-farm culture; Lactate

A fast and accurate method to identify HAI will assist in the diagnosis and identification of appropriate patient treatment and in controlling future outbreaks. Based on recently developed new methods for genomic data extraction, representation and analysis in bioinformatics, we propose an entirely new method for species identification. The accuracy of the new methods is very competitive and in several cases outperforms the standard spectroscopic protein-based MALDI-TOF MS commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories and public healthcare settings, at least prior to translation to a clinical setting. The proposed method relies on a model of hybridization that is robust to frameshifts and thus is likely to provide resilience to length variability in the sonication of the samples, probably one of the major challenges in a translation to clinical settings.",English,,Proceedings Paper,"Hospital-acquired infections; Identification; Next-generation nxh

10.1371/journal.pone.0103950,PLOS ONE,2014,Applying of Hierarchical Clustering to Analysis of Protein Patterns in the Human Cancer-Associated Liver,"Petushkova, NA","Background: There are two ways that statistical methods can learn from biomedical data. One way is to learn classifiers to identify diseases and to predict outcomes using the training dataset with established diagnosis for each sample. When the training dataset is not available the task can be to mine for presence of meaningful groups (clusters) of samples and to explore underlying data structure (unsupervised learning). Results: We investigated the proteomic profiles of the cytosolic fraction of human liver samples using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Samples were resected upon surgical treatment of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 2DE gel images (n = 18) revealed a pair of clusters, containing 11 and 7 samples. Previously we used the same specimens to measure biochemical profiles based on cytochrome P450-dependent enzymatic activities and also found that samples were clearly divided into two well-separated groups by cluster analysis. It turned out that groups by enzyme activity almost perfectly match to the groups identified from proteomic data. Of the 271 reproducible spots on our 2DE gels, we selected 15 to distinguish the human liver cytosolic clusters. Using MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting, we identified 12 proteins for the selected spots, including known cancer-associated species. Conclusions/Significance: Our results highlight the importance of hierarchical cluster analysis of proteomic data, and showed concordance between results of biochemical and proteomic approaches. Grouping of the human liver samples and/or patients into differing clusters may provide insights into possible molecular mechanism of drug metabolism and creates a rationale for personalized treatment.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,

This study aimed to explore potential serum biomarkers associated with depression.Methods Serum samples from a training group comprising 48 depression patients and 48 healthy controls underwent proteomic analysis. Magnetic bead-based weak cation exchange (MB-WCX) and MALDI-TOF-MS were used in combination. To screen the differential peaks, ClinProTools software was employed. The proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS. ELISA was employed to confirm the expression of entire protein in the serum of the verification cohort, which encompassed 48 individuals who had been diagnosed with Depression and 48 healthy controls who were collected prospectively. Subsequently, logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the diagnostic efficacy of the aforementioned predictors.Results Five potential biomarker peaks indicating depression were identified in serum samples (peak 1, m/z: 1868.21; peak 2, m/z: 1062.35; peak 3, m/z: 1452.12; peak 4, m/z: 1208.72; peak 5, m/z: 1619.58). All of these peaks had higher expression in the pre-therapy group and were confirmed to be Tubulin beta chain (TUBB), Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), Complement component 3 (C3), and Complement C4A precursor (C4A) by ELISA validation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum levels of TUBB, ITIH4, C3, and C4A were significant independent risk factors for the development of depression.Conclusion Depression is a prevalent psychiatric condition. Timely detection is challenging, resulting in poor prognoses for patients. Our study on plasma proteomics for depression demonstrated that TUBB, ITIH4, C3, and C4A differentiate between depression patients and healthy controls. The proteins that were identified could potentially function as biomarkers for the diagnosis of depression. Pinpointing these biomarkers could enable early identification of depression, which would advance precise treatment.",English,gold,Article,depression; serum; biomarker; mass spectrometry; early diagnosis

Various computational tools based on machine-learning and data-mining methods like feature selection/extraction have been proposed to escape the curse of dimensionality in large datasets. Incidentally, evolutionary studies, primarily based on sequentially evolved variations have remained un-facilitated by such advances till date. Here, we present a novel approach of recursive feature selection for hierarchical clustering of Y-chromosomal SNPs/haplogroups to select a minimal set of independent markers, sufficient to infer population structure as precisely as deduced by a larger number of evolutionary markers. To validate the applicability of our approach, we optimally designed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based multiplex to accommodate independent Y-chromosomal markers in a single multiplex and genotyped two geographically distinct Indian populations. An analysis of 105 world-wide populations reflected that 15 independent variations/markers were optimal in defining population structure parameters, such as F-ST, molecular variance and correlation-based relationship. A subsequent addition of randomly selected markers had a negligible effect (close to zero, i. e. 1 x 10(-3)) on these parameters. The study proves efficient in tracing complex population structures and deriving relationships among world-wide populations in a cost-effective and expedient manner.",English,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",Article,

Embedding hepatocytes in a sandwich of extracellular matrix is reported to delay the dedifferentiation process to some extent. In this study, we compared the intracellular proteome of primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) in conventional monolayer cultures (ML) to collagen sandwich culture (SW) after 1 day and 5 days of cultivation. Quantitative proteome analysis of PMH showed no differences between collagen SW and ML cultures after 1 day. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were strongly affected by long-term cultivation in both ML and SW cultures. Interestingly, culture conditions had no effect on cellular lipid metabolism. After 5 days, PMH in collagen SW and ML cultures exhibit characteristic indications of oxidative stress. However, in the SW culture the defense system against oxidative stress is significantly up-regulated to deal with this, whereas in the ML culture a down-regulation of these important enzymes takes place. Regarding the multiple effects of ROS and oxidative stress in cells, we conclude that the down-regulation of these enzymes seem to play a role in the loss of hepatic function observed in the ML cultivation. In addition, enzymes of the urea cycle were clearly down-regulated in ML culture. Proteomics confirms lack in oxidative stress defense mechanisms as the major characteristic of hepatocytes in monolayer cultures compared to sandwich cultures. J. Cell. Biochem. 119: 447-454, 2018.

To improve embedding of the nanofillers within the acrylate matrix the filler surface was chemically modified. This modification of the silica and alumina nanoparticles was accomplished by trimethoxysilanes having methacryloxypropyl (MEMO), vinyl (VTMO), and n-propyl (PTMO) functionalities. Due to acid catalyzed condensation of organosilanes a polysiloxane shell was formed around the nanoparticles. This shell is bonded to OH groups on the filler surface. The appearance of covalent Si-O-Si-R bonds was clearly shown by multinuclear MAS NMR. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy revealed the formation of polysiloxane oligomers with different degrees of condensation. In the work presented, an acrylate-nanocomposite formulation contains up to 35 wt.% nanosized silica covered with polysiloxanes. For MEMO modification, surface-anchored methacryl groups can copolymerize with network acrylates. But also PTMO-modified composite materials exhibit markedly improved properties as compared to the neat acrylate polymer; e.g., an increased modulus and heat resistance, improved scratch and abrasion resistance. This makes polyacrylate nanocomposites a very promising new coating technology for many far reaching technical applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Conventionally, the assessment of stenosis degree relies on invasive coronary angiography (ICA), an invasive examination unsuitable for patients in poor physical condition or those with contrast allergies and one that imposes a psychological burden on patients. Although abnormal serum N-glycan profiles have exhibited robust associations with various cardiovascular diseases, including CAD, their potential in diagnosing CAD stenosis remains to be determined. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of serum N-glycome from 132 patients who underwent ICA and 27 healthy controls using MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry. The patients who underwent ICA examination were categorized into four groups based on stenosis severity: no/mild/moderate/severe stenosis. Twenty-seven N-glycans were directly quantified, and 47 derived glycan traits were obtained. Notably, among these 74 glycan features, 18 exhibited variations across the study groups. Using a combination of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyses, we developed five diagnostic models for recognizing stenosis degree. Our results suggested that alterations in serum N-glycosylation modifications might be valuable for identifying stenosis degree and monitoring disease progression in individuals with CAD. It is expected to offer a noninvasive alternative for those who could not undergo ICA because of various reasons. However, the diagnostic potential of serum N-glycan panels as biomarkers requires multicenter, large cohort validation in the future.",English,gold,Article,"N-glycomic profiling; Biomarkers; Mass spectrometry; Coronary artery

A diagnostic model comprising of four protein peaks (M/Z 4964, 3029, 2833, 2900) can well distinguish CD patients and HCs, with a specificity and sensitivity of 96.7% and 96.7% respectively. A diagnostic model comprising four protein peaks (M/Z 3030, 2105, 2545, 4210) can well distinguish ITB patients and HCs, with a specificity and sensitivity of 93.3% and 95.2% respectively. A differential diagnostic model comprising three potential biomarkers protein peaks (M/Z 4267, 4223, 1541) can well distinguish CD patients and ITB patients, with a specificity and sensitivity of 76.2% and 80.0% respectively. Among the eleven protein peaks from the diagnostic models and differential diagnostic model, two have been successfully purified and identified, Those two peaks were M/Z 2900 from the diagnostic model between CD and HCs and M/Z 1541 from the differential diagnostic model between CD and ITB. M/Z 2900 was identified as appetite peptide, M/Z 1541 was identified as Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL-2). Conclusion The differently expressed protein peaks analyzed by serum proteome with weak cationic magnetic beads combined MALDI-TOF-MS technique can effectively distinguish CD patients and HCs, ITB patients and HCs, CD patients and ITB patients. The diagnostic model between CD patients and HCs consisting of four protein peaks (M/Z 4964, 3029, 2833, 2900), the diagnostic model between ITB patients and HCs comprising four protein peaks (M/Z 3030, 2105, 2545, 4210) and the differential diagnostic model between CD patients and ITB patients comprising three protein peaks (M/Z 4267, 4223, 1541) had high specificity and sensitivity and can contribute to diagnoses of CD, ITB and the differential diagnosis between CD and ITB. Two proteins from the diagnostic model of CD and the differential diagnostic model between CD and ITB were identified. Further experiments are required using a larger cohort of samples.",English,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",Article,

Although new varieties of maize have been extensively developed in Korea, little is known about differences in the proteomes of mature kernels among maize varieties. Three Korean waxy corn cultivars (Ilmichal, Eolrukchal 1, and Heukjinjuchal) have previously been developed. The total protein content is higher in Ilmichal than in Eolrukchal 1 or Heukjinjuchal, while the starch and fatty acid contents are similar among these three Korean waxy corns. To uncover the differences in proteomic profiles among these three Korean waxy corns, we performed proteomic analysis and compared their protein compositions. We detected 37 differentially expressed protein spots and identified the proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Of these proteins, 37.8 % were identified as storage proteins, 18.9 % as stress-related proteins, and 18.9 % as metabolism-related proteins. Storage proteins (globulin-2) and stress-related proteins (heat shock proteins and general stress proteins) were highly expressed in Ilmichal or Heukjinjuchal. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of corresponding genes of five randomly selected proteins, including glyoxalase family protein (accession number, B6SGF3), globulin-2 (Q7M1Z8), heat shock protein 1 and 3 (B6TGQ2 and B6TDB5), and vicilin-like embryo storage protein (Q03865), showed that the expression levels of the tested genes were well-correlated with protein abundance, suggesting that these proteins are also differentially regulated at the transcriptional level. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of proteomic differences among Korean waxy corn cultivars and may support further molecular breeding efforts.",English,Bronze,Article,Maize; Kernel; Proteomics; Waxy corn; 2-DE

Fetal (E13.5, E16.5), newborn (NB), postnatal (3-week) and adult (3-month) livers were isolated and profiled by 2-D PAGE. Statistical analysis using linear regression and false discovery rate (FDR) revealed that 361 protein spots showed significant changes. Unsupervised hierarchical tree analysis segregated the proteins into fetal, NB, and postnatal-adult clusters. Distinctive protein markers were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS and the corresponding mRNA profiles were further determined by Q-PCR. Fetal markers (hPCNA, hHSP7C, hHEM6) and postnatal-adult markers (hARGI1, hASSY hBHMT hFABPL) were selected for testing against a panel of seven human hepatocyte/HCC cell lines and 59 clinical specimens. The fetal proteins were found to be overexpressed in the metastatic HCC cell lines and the tumor tissues, whereas the postnatal-adult proteins were expressed in non-tumor tissues and normal hepatocytes. This ""Ying-Yang"" pattern, as orchestrated by distinct fetal and adult markers, is hypothesized to indicate the progressive change of the liver from a growing, less-differentiated organ into a functional metabolic center. Thus, embryogenesis and tumorigenesis share certain oncofetal markers and adult ""hepatic"" phenotypes are lost in HCC.",English,,Article,"biomarkers; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver embryo; oncofetal proteins;

We collected information on potential confounders via questionnaire. Culture of participants' stool samples was performed with ChromID (R)-ESBL agar plates and species identification with MALDI-TOF-MS. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC). Sensitivity analyses included stratification by country and interaction models using country as secondary exposure. Prevalence of ESBL-EC was 11% (workers), 29% (nearby residents), and 7% (distant residents), and higher in Romania (28%) than in Germany (7%) and the Netherlands (6%). Models stratified by country showed that within the Romanian population, WWTP workers are about twice as likely (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.22-4.50) and nearby residents about three times as likely (aOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.80-5.59) to be ESBL-EC carriers, when compared with distant residents. In stratified analyses by country, we found an increased risk for carriage of ESBL-EC in Romanian workers and nearby residents. This effect was higher for nearby residents than for workers, which suggests that, for nearby residents, factors other than the local WWTP could contribute to the increased carriage.",English,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",Article; Early Access,"Antimicrobial resistance; Antibiotic resistance; ESBL-producing E; coli;

Although the underlying etiological mechanisms for disease development are not yet known, there is evidence that a latent infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) might be involved. The polymorphism rs12979860 has been associated with the severity of recurrent herpes labialis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and treatment outcome and is located within the first intron of the IFNL4 gene on chromosome 19.q13.2. This case control study was conducted to evaluate the association of rs12979860 with VN occurrence. Methods:DNA was extracted from EDTA blood of 151 VN patients and 1,775 healthy controls. Genotyping of rs12979860 was performed using iPLEX and MassARRAY Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. For association analyses, an additive, dominant and recessive logistic regression model was calculated, using age and sex as covariates. Results:A significant association of rs12979860 with VN was obtained for the additive [OR = 1.51 (1.18-1.92);p= 9.23 x 10(-4)] and dominant models [OR = 2.15 (1.48-3.13);p= 5.86 x 10(-5)], with the T allele being more frequent in the VN group.

Total cellular proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), analyzed by MALDI/TOF-TOF MS, and identified by a database search. Expression of 14-3-3 beta and profilin-1 was then immunohistochemically verified in paraffin-embedded gastric cancer tissues from 128 patients and analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 26 differentially expressed proteins were identified, 20 of which were overexpressed and 6 of which were underexpressed. 14-3-3 beta and profilin-1 were upregulated in gastric cancer tissues with and without lymph node metastasis, respectively. Expression of 14-3-3 beta protein was associated, but profilin-1 expression was inversely associated with gastric cancer lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of 14-3-3 beta and reduced expression of profilin-1 were independent risk factors for gastric cancer lymph node metastasis, while 14-3-3 beta overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients. The current study identified 26 differentially expressed proteins.

Indeed, macrocyclic polymers are considered as the ultimate destination of polycondensations for AB or A(2) + B-2 monomer combinations. Here, we present a new strategy to limit the macrocyclization process towards the selective formation of linear polyesters in the polycondensations of omega-hydroxyaliphatic acid and the combinations of dicarboxylic acids and diols. By embedding the catalyst (sulfonic acid) in dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs), the polyesterifications were ushered to exclusively take place in the confined nanopores of DMSNs. The distribution of the alpha,omega-ends in different positions in the bundle of polyesters limited the end-to-end cyclization, leading to the selective chain extension especially in the high molecular weight region. NMR, GPC and MALDI-TOF results show that while the polyesters obtained in homogeneous polycondensation or with a nonporous heterogeneous catalyst were mainly with cyclic structures, the selective formation of linear polyesters was found in the confined nanopores of DMSNs. This finding contradicts the general sense that confined geometries are in favor of macrocyclization and provides a new understanding to manipulate the polymerization process towards the control of cyclic and linear topologies.",English,Bronze,Article,

Since the pattern of fat distribution and the relationship between fat distribution and glucose metabolism disturbance in Chinese are different from those in Europeans, the present study aimed to explore the individual and cumulative effects of WHR-related loci on glycemic phenotypes in Chinese children. Methods: A total of 2030 children were recruited from two independent studies. Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected arid genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS). Logistic regression and linear regression model were used to examine the association of 11 SNPs and genetic risk score (GRS) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), respectively. Results: Three SNPs (rs6795735, rs984222 and rs1011731) were nominally associated with IFG (all P < 0.05). Each WHR-increasing (C) allele of rs6795735 (ADAMTS9) was associated with a 40.1% increased risk of IFG (OR = 1.401, 95% CI = 1.131-1.735, P = 0.002), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. We observed no association of both weighted and unweighted GRS with FPG and IFG (all P> 0.05). Conclusions: We identified individual effects of rs6795735 (ADAMTS9), rs984222 (TBX15-WARS2), and rs1011731 (DNM3-P1GC) on glycemic phenotypes in Chinese children for the first time.

The sex hormones play an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. However, the conclusions of the previous genetic relation studies are conflicting. The aim of this study is to determine whether variants in genes involved in estrogen receptor and estrogen hormone metabolism are related to Chinese migraine. By employing a case-control approach, 8 SNPs in the ESR1, ESR2, and CYP19A1 genes are studied in a cohort of 494 migraine cases and 533 controls. In addition, genotyping is performed using Sequenom MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry iPLEX platform. Univariate and multivariate analyses are carried out by logistic regression. The corresponding haplotypes are studied with the Haploview software and genegene interaction is assessed using the Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) analysis. There are significant differences in allelic distributions for rs2234693 and rs9340799 in ESR1 gene between patients with migraine and control subjects. Univariate logistic analysis shows that rs2234693 and rs9340799 are risk factors for migraine, but multivariate analysis reveals that only rs2234693 is significant associated with migraine. In the subgroup analysis, rs2234693 in ESR1 gene is found associated with menstrually related migraine. Further haplotypic analysis shows that rs2234693-rs9340799 TA haplotype serves as risk haplotype for migraine. The GMDR analysis identifies rs2234693 in ESR1 alone to be a crucial candidate in migraine susceptibility. This study is in agreement with the previous studies that variants in the ESR1 gene are associated with migraine suggesting that it plays a role in the migraine process.",English,,Article,Migraine; Polymorphism; ESR1; ESR2; CYP19A1; China

Next, a supervised neural network (SNN) algorithm model is established by ClinProTools and the candidate biomarker identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Finally, the candidate biomarker is validated in tissue samples. Results The SNN algorithm model discriminates PC from HC with 92.97% sensitivity and 94.55% specificity. Seventy-six differentially expressed peptides are identified, seven of which are significantly different among PC, PP, and HC (p < 0.05). Only one peak (m/z: 1466.99) tends to be upregulated in samples from HC, PP, and PC, which is identified as region of RNA-binding motif protein 6 (RBM6).

Grain filling, the developmental stage of the seed during which starch and proteins accumulate, is of great interest in plant biology and agronomy. However, proteomic datasets covering maize seed development, especially during grain filling, are much scarcer than transcriptomic datasets, largely due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of the large-scale analysis required for proteomics. Here, we searched for proteins that showed changes in abundance during four time-points covering the middle stages of grain filling by two-dimensional electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF, and database searches. We detected 1384 protein spots, of which 48 exhibited differential accumulation during grain filling. Of those, we identified the underlying protein for 32 spots: they included enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, stress-related proteins, and storage proteins, the latter of which represented 34% of all changing proteins during grain filling. Proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism reached their maximum accumulation around 15-20 days after pollination (DAP) and subsequently dropped until 30 DAP. The rise of stress-related proteins such as heat shock proteins demonstrated their involvement in grain filling and seed maturation.

To fill the need for expression analysis of such genes, we employed the Affymetrix technology to develop a focused and highly annotated glycogene-chip representing human and murine glycogenes, including glycosyltransferases, nucleotide sugar transporters, glycosidases, proteoglycans, and glycan-binding proteins. In this report, the array has been used to generate glycogene-expression profiles of nine murine tissues. Global analysis with a hierarchical clustering algorithm reveals that expression profiles in immune tissues (thymus [THY], spleen [SPL], lymph node, and bone marrow [BM]) are more closely related, relative to those of nonimmune tissues (kidney [KID], liver [LIV], brain [BRN], and testes [TES]). Of the biosynthetic enzymes, those responsible for synthesis of the core regions of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides are ubiquitously expressed, whereas glycosyltransferases that elaborate terminal structures are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, accounting for tissue and ultimately cell-type-specific glycosylation. Comparison of gene expression profiles with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) profiling of N-linked oligosaccharides suggested that the alpha 1-3 fucosyltransferase 9, Fut9, is the enzyme responsible for terminal fucosylation in KID and BRN, a finding validated by analysis of Fut9 knockout mice. Two families of glycan-binding proteins, C-type lectins and Siglecs, are predominately expressed in the immune tissues, consistent with their emerging functions in both innate and acquired immunity.

Two unsupervised cluster analyses revealed that CRCs form three distinct DNA methylation subsets, which are referred to as the high-, intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME, respectively). A recent study by Yagi et al. found a fairly sensitive and specific identification of HME, IME, and LME using two marker panels analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MassARRAY). However, the expensive equipment required for this method substantially increases the cost and complexity of the assay. In this article, we demonstrate the assessment of HME, IME, and LME in a group of 233 sporadic CRCs using seven markers proposed by Yagi et al. The DNA methylation of each marker was quantified using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and analyzed along with various genetic factors associated with CRC [the BRAF and KRAS mutations, MLH1 methylation and microsatellite instability (MSI)]. The baseline methylation of each marker was generated from pooled DNA isolated from 50 normal colon tissues. We demonstrate that the correlation of HME, IME, and LME epigenotyped by COBRA using different molecular classifiers is similar to that achieved by MassARRAY. Therefore, epigenotyping CRCs using COBRA is a simple, specific, and cost-effective method that has the potential to be widely used in CRC research.

Current clinical diagnostic criteria are based on electrophysiological examination and exclusion of other ALS-mimicking conditions. Neuroprotective treatments are, however, most promising in early disease stages. Identification of disease-specific CSF biomarkers and associated biochemical pathways is therefore most relevant to monitor disease progression, response to neuroprotective agents and to enable early inclusion of patients into clinical trials. Methods and Findings: CSF from 35 patients with ALS diagnosed according to the revised El Escorial criteria and 23 age-matched controls was processed using paramagnetic bead chromatography for protein isolation and subsequently analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. CSF protein profiles were integrated into a Random Forest model constructed from 153 mass peaks. After reducing this peak set to the top 25%, a classifier was built which enabled prediction of ALS with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Further analysis of the identified peptides resulted in a panel of five highly sensitive ALS biomarkers. Upregulation of secreted phosphoprotein 1 in ALS-CSF samples was confirmed by univariate analysis of ELISA and mass spectrometry data. Further quantitative validation of the five biomarkers was achieved in an 80-plex Multiple Reaction Monitoring mass spectrometry assay. Conclusions: ALS classification based on the CSF biomarker panel proposed in this study could become a valuable predictive tool for early clinical risk stratification. Of the numerous CSF proteins identified, many have putative roles in ALS-related metabolic processes, particularly in chromogranin-mediated secretion signaling pathways. While a stand-alone clinical application of this classifier will only be possible after further validation and a multicenter trial, it could be readily used to complement current ALS diagnostics and might also provide new insights into the pathomechanisms of this disease in the future.",English,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",Article,

Radiotherapy acts on cancer cells largely due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS also induce normal tissue toxicities. Therefore, we investigated if genetic variation in oxidative stress-related enzymes confers increased susceptibility to late skin complications. Women who received radiotherapy following lumpectomy for breast cancer were followed prospectively for late tissue side effects after initial treatment. Final analysis included 390 patients. Polymorphisms in genes involved in oxidative stress-related mechanisms (GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, MPO, MnSOD, eNOS, CAD were determined from blood samples by MALDI-TOF. The associations between telangiectasia and genotypes were evaluated by multivariate unconditional logistic regression models. Patients with variant GSTA1 genotypes were at significantly increased risk of telangiectasia (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.11-3.11). Reduced odds ratios of telangiectasia were noted for women with lower-activity eNOS genotype (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93). Genotype effects were modified by follow-up time, with the highest risk observed after 4 years of radiotherapy for gene polymorphisms in ROS-neutralizing enzymes. Decreased risk with eNOS polymorphisms was significant only among women with less than 4 years of follow-up. All other risk estimates were nonsignificant. Late effects of radiation therapy on skin appear to be modified by variants in genes related to protection from oxidative stress. The application of genomics to outcomes following radiation therapy holds the promise of radiation dose adjustment to improve both cosmetic outcomes and quality of life for breast cancer patients.

Bonferroni testing was employed to correct for multiple comparisons.Results: Among the SNPs genotyped, p values of six SNPs were less than 0.05 between AMD cases and unaffected controls. However, after Bonferroni correction, the genotype and allele distributions of only two SNPs, rs9554322 and rs9582036 differed significantly between the controls and AMD patients. Further, the rs9554322 CC genotype conferred strong susceptibility to AMD (OR = 6.057, 95% CI: 3.099-11.839). Rs9943922 was also found to be significantly associated with AMD in the distributions for the genotype and allele recessive model (p = 0.004). The specific haplotype CA of rs9582036 and rs9554320 was associated with AMD (p = 0.035), but the correlation did not remain after correction.Conclusions: The SNPs rs9554322, rs9582036 and rs9943922 were correlated with AMD. Gene variants in VEGFR1 were linked to a pronounced emerging risk for AMD in a population in northern China.",English,,Article,Age-related macular degeneration; genetic polymorphisms; VEGFR1 gene

Objective: To determine associations between polymorphisms in leukotriene pathway candidate genes with outcomes in patients with asthma receiving montelukast for 6 mo who participated in a clinical trial. Methods: Polymorphisms were typed using Sequenom matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass array spectrometry and published methods; haplotypes were imputed using single nucleotide polymorphism-expectation maximization (SNP-EM). Analysis of variance and logistic regression models were used to test for changes in outcomes by genotype. In addition, chi(2) and likelihood ratio tests were used to test for differences between groups. Case-control comparisons were analyzed using the SNP-EM Omnibus likelihood ratio test. Measurements: Outcomes were asthma exacerbation rate and changes in FEV1 compared with baseline. Results: DNA was collected from 252 participants: 69% were white, 26% were African American. Twenty-eight SNPs in the ALOX5, LTA4H, LTC4S, MRP1, and cysLT1R genes, and an ALOX5 repeat polymorphism were successfully typed. There were racial disparities in allele frequencies in 17 SNPs and in the repeat polymorphism. Association analyses were performed in 61 whites. Associations were found between genotypes of SNPs in the ALOX5 (rs2115819) and MRP1 (rs119774) genes and changes in FEV1 (p < 0.05), and between two SNPs in LTC4S (rs730012) and in LTA4H (rs2660845) genes for exacerbation rates. Mutant ALOX5 repeat polymorphism was associated with decreased exacerbation rates. There was strong linkage disequilibrium between ALOX5 SNPs. Associations between ALOX5 haplotypes and risk of exacerbations were found. Conclusions: Genetic variation in leukotriene pathway candidate genes contributes to variability in montelukast response.",English,Green Published,Article,antiinflammatory; montelukast; pharmacodynamic; pharmacogenetic

To assess potential genetic associations between the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene in the chromosome 8q24 locus and breast cancer risk in Korean women, 13 SNPs were selected and associations with breast cancer risk were analyzed with reference to hormone receptor (HR) and menopausal status. Methods: We analyzed DNA extracted from buffy coat from 456 patients and 461 control samples, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) based upon region-specific PCR followed by allele-specific single base primer extension reactions. Risks associated with PSCA genotypes and haplotypes were estimated with chi-square test (chi(2) -test), and polytomous logistic regression models using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), by HR and menopausal status. Results: In case-control analysis, odds ratios (OR) of rs2294009, rs2294008, rs2978981, rs2920298, rs2976395, and rs2976396 were statistically significant only among women with estrogen receptor (ER) negative cancers, and those of rs2294008, rs2978981, rs2294010, rs2920298, rs2976394, rs10216533, and rs2976396 were statistically significant only in pre-menopausal women, and not in postmenopausal women. Risk with the TTGGCAA haplotype was significantly elevated in ER (-) status (OR= 1.48, 95% CI= 1.03 similar to 2.12, p < 0.05). Especially risk of allele T of rs2294008 is significantly low in pre-menopausal breast cancer patients and AA genotype of rs2976395 in ER (-) status represents the increase of OR value. Conclusion: This report indicated for the first time that associations exist between PSCA SNPs and breast cancer susceptibility in Korean women, particularly those who are pre-menopausal with an estrogen receptor negative tumor status.",English,"gold, Green Submitted",Article,PSCA; breast cancer; 8q24; polymorphism; biomarker

RLS is a frequent and distressing comorbidity in end stage renal disease (ESRD). For idiopathic RLS (iRLS), genetic risk factors have been identified, but their role in RLS in ESRD has not been investigated yet. Therefore, a case-control association study of these variants in ESRD patients was performed. Methods The study genotyped 10 iRLS associated variants at four loci encompassing the genes MEIS1, BTBD9, MAP2K5/SKOR1, and PTPRD, in two independent case-control samples from Germany and Greece using multiplex PCR and MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed as logistic regression with age and gender as covariates. For the combined analysis a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was applied. Results The study included 200 RLS-positive and 443 RLS-negative ESRD patients in the German sample, and 141 and 393 patients, respectively, in the Greek sample. In the German sample, variants in MEIS1 and BTBD9 were associated with RLS in ESRD (P-nom <= 0.004, ORs 1.52 and 1.55), whereas, in the Greek sample, there was a trend for association to MAP2K5/SKOR1 and BTBD9 (P-nom <= 0.08, ORs 1.41 and 1.33). In the combined analysis including all samples, BTBD9 was associated after correction for multiple testing (P-corrected=0.0013, OR 1.47). Conclusions This is the first demonstration of a genetic influence on RLS in ESRD patients with BTBD9 being significantly associated. The extent of the genetic predisposition could vary between different subgroups of RLS in ESRD.",English,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",Article,

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of TC among school-children in the Dschang Subdivision, Western Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was carried out in June 2021 in Dschang including pupils aged 5-13. First, a standardized questionnaire was administered to participant for the collection of sociodemographic data. Then, samples were collected and cultured onto Sabouraud-Chloramphenicol-Gentamicin Agar. The etiological agents were identified based on their morphological features and with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 1070 children were clinically examined and 108 (10.1%) children presented with TC lesions. The mean age of the 1070 participants was 8.3 +/- 2.6 years (range: 5-13 years); 772 (72.2%) were males.

Selenium is an essential micronutrient and a powerful antioxidant in the brain and nervous system. Several recent studies have reported a relationship between selenium levels and depression. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between 4 genes co-associated with selenium and geriatric depression. 1486 participants were included in this study from 5 communities in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region during 2013 to 2016 in a health examination program for urban and rural residents. Polymorphisms of 4 selenium-related genes were analyzed in 1266 healthy volunteers and 220 patients with depression. The genotyping of rs2830072, rs2030324, rs6265, rs11136000, rs7982, rs10510412, rs1801282, rs1151999, rs17793951, rs709149, rs709154, and rs4135263 were performed by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) technology. The analysis of selenium-related genes showed that there were significant differences between depression and controls for allele and genotype frequencies of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG) rs10510412, rs709149, and rs709154 (all P < .05). In this study, when adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education, and alcohol consumption, results showed that rs709149 and rs709154 were still significantly correlated with geriatric depression in the codominant, dominant, overdominant, and log-additive models. Logistic regression analysis showed that rs709149 AG or GG gene carriers were 1.630 and 1.746 times more susceptible to depression than AA gene carriers (95% CI = 1.042-2.549; 1.207-2.526).

We investigated 11 genes encoding key proteins of this pathway for their potential contribution to breast cancer risk. Of these CYP17A1, CYP19A1, EPHX1, HSD17B1, SRD5A2, and PPARG2 participate in biosynthesis, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, COMT, GSTP1, and SOD2 in catabolism and detoxification. We performed a population-based case-control study with 688 incident breast cancer cases and 724 controls from Germany and genotyped 18 polymorphisms by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), PCR based RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism), and TaqMan (R) allelic discrimination. Genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls and odds ratios were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Further statistical analyses were based on cluster analysis, multifactor dimensionality reduction, logic regression, and global testing. Single factor analyses pointed to CYP1B1_1294_GG as a possible breast cancer risk modulator (OR = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.34-4.93) and two way stratification suggested associations between BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) and COMT_472_GG (P = 0.0076 and P = 0.0026), BMI < 20 kg/m(2) and HSD17B1_937_GG (P = 0.0082) as well as CYP17A1_-34_CC and HRT use >= 10 years (P = 0.0063). Following correction for multiple testing none of these associations remained significant. No significant association between breast cancer risk and genetic polymorphisms was observed in multifactor analyses. The tested polymorphisms of the estrogen metabolic pathway may not play a direct role in breast cancer risk. Therefore, future association studies should be extended to other polymorphisms and other regulatory pathways.",English,,Article,"breast cancer; susceptibility; estrogen metabolism; polymorphisms;

The common non-synonymous polymorphisms CYP1B1_1358_A > G and CYP1B1_1294_C > G increase CYP1B1 enzymatic activity. Given a relationship between CYP1B1 and breast tumor E2 level as well as E2 level and breast tumor ER alpha expression it is of interest to know whether CYP1B1 polymorphisms have an impact on the ER alpha status of breast cancer. We genotyped the GENICA population-based breast cancer case-control collection (1,021 cases, 1,015 controls) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and investigated in cases the association between genotypes and tumor ER alpha status (739 ER alpha positive cases; 212 ER alpha negative cases) by logistic regression. We observed a significant association between the homozygous variant CYP1B1_1358_GG genotype and negative ER alpha status (P = 0.005; OR 2.82, 95% CI: 1.37-5.82) with a highly significant P (trend) for CYP1B1_1358_A > G and negative ER alpha status (P = 0.003).

Therefore, it is highly relevant to further improve understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of HER2 expression. In addition to gene amplification, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in HER2 overexpression. In this study, we analyzed 3 polymorphisms E2F2_-5368-A>G, CCND1-870-A>G and CCND3_-677_C>T located in genes involved in cell cycle regulation in the GENICA population-based and age-matched breast cancer case-control study from Germany. We genotyped 1,021 cases and 1,015 controls by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Statistical analyses were performed by conditional logistic regression. We observed no differences in genotype frequencies between breast cancer cases and controls. Subgroup analysis showed associations between carriers of the E2F2_-5368_G allele (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.85), carriers of the (C) over bar CND (1) over bar _870 G allele (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.96) and carriers of the -CC (N) over bar D3_-677_T allele (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.20-2.49) and HER2 expression in breast tumors. This finding points to an association of an increased expression of these cell cycle regulators with lower expression of HER2. An explanation for this observation might be that low expression of E2F2, CCND1 and CCND3 decrease levels of factors down-regulating HER2. We conclude that the analyzed polymorphisms located in E2F2, CCND1 and CCAID3 are potential markers for HER2 status of breast tumors.

However, accurate interpretation of OFC results requires trained and experienced operators, which could be a limitation for the use of OFC in dairy farms. Our hypothesis was that AI-based automated plate reading mobile application can analyze images of microorganisms' colonies in chromogenic culture media with similar diagnostic performance as a trained specialist evaluator. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-based application (Rumi; OnFarm, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil) for interpreting images of mastitis causing microorganism colonies grown in chromogenic culture media. For this study two trials were organized to compare the results obtained using an AI-based application Rumi with the interpretation of: (1) a trained specialist, using MALDI-TOF MS as the gold standard; (2) farm personnel users (FPU). In trial 1, a total of 476 CM milk samples, from 11 farms located in Sao Paulo (n = 7) and Minas Gerais (n = 4), southeast Brazil, were inoculated in chromogenic culture media plates (Smartcolor 2, OnFarm, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil) by specialists under lab conditions, and digital images were recorded 24 h after incubation at 37 degrees C. After that, all the 476 digital images were analyzed by the Rumi and by another specialist (who only had access to the digital images) and the diagnostic accuracy indicators sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were calculated using MALDI-TOF MS microbiological identification of the isolates as the reference. In Trial 2, a total of 208 CM milk samples, from 150 farms from Brazil, were inoculated in chromogenic culture media plates by FPU, and the results of microbiological growth were visually interpreted by FPU under on-farm conditions. After visual interpretation, results were recorded using an OnFarmApp application (herd manage application for mastitis by OnFarm, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the images of the chromogenic culture plates were captured by the OnFarmApp to be evaluated by Rumi and Bayesian Latent Class Models were performed to compare Rumi and the FPU. In Trial 1, Rumi presented high and intermediate accuracy results, with the only exception of the low Enterococcus spp.'s Se. In comparison with the specialist, Rumi performed similarly in Se and Sp for most groups of pathogens, with the only exception of non-aureus staphylococci where Se results were lower. Both Rumi and the specialist achieved Sp results > 0.96. In Trial 2, Rumi had similar results as the FPU in the Bayesian Latent Class Model analysis.

The wide variety of histologies and tumor characteristics makes diagnosis and treatment challenging. In the present study, Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to discriminate the pathological regions of patient-derived biopsies of parotid neoplasms by metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Fresh frozen parotid tissues were analyzed by MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) MSI, both in positive and negative ionization modes, and additional MALDI-Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MSI was carried out for metabolite annotation. MALDI-TOF-MSI spatial segmentation maps with different molecular signatures were compared with the histologic annotation. To maximize the information related to specific alterations between the pathological and healthy tissues, unsupervised (principal component analysis, PCA) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis, PLS-DA) multivariate analyses were performed presenting a 95.00% accuracy in cross-validation. Glycerophospholipids significantly increased in tumor tissues, while sphin-gomyelins and triacylglycerols, key players in the signaling pathway and energy production, were sensibly reduced. In addition, a significant increase of amino acids and nucleotide intermediates, consistent with the bioenergetics request of tumor cells, was observed.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of methylation levels revealed no distinct subgroups between MSI and MSS samples or cell lines. CFSs clustered together showing higher levels of RUNX3 methylation compared to GC samples. RUNX3 showed protein silencing in cancer and normal mucosa, compared to inflammatory peritumoural infiltrate in almost all cases, showing a non-lymphocytic predominant pattern and being correlated with epigenetic silencing. Our results show aberrant promoter's methylation in APC, CDH1, CDKN2A, MLH1 and RUNX3 associated with GC, as well as a non-lymphocytic predominant infiltrate with high expression of RUNX3. Deep study of RUNX3 inflammation signaling could help in understanding inflammation and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment.",English,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",Article,RUNX3; ARID1A; gastric cancer; gene methylation; immune microenvironment
10.7150/thno.80435,THERANOSTICS,2023,Integration of metabolomics and peptidomics reveals distinct molecular landscape of human diabetic kidney disease,"Jiang, XR","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, and there is an urgent need to discover reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. Here, we established an effective urine multi-omics platform and integrated metabolomics and peptidomics to investigate the biological changes during DKD pathogenesis. Methods: Totally 766 volunteers (221 HC, 198 T2DM, 175 early DKD, 125 overt DKD, and 47 grey-zone T2DM patients with abnormal urinary mALB concentration) were included in this study. Non-targeted metabolic fingerprints of urine samples were acquired on matrix-free LDI-MS platform by the tip-contact extraction method using fluorinated ethylene propylene coated silicon nanowires chips (FEP@SiNWs), while peptide profiles hidden in urine samples were uncovered by MALDI-TOF MS after capturing urine peptides by porous silicon microparticles. Results: After multivariate analysis, ten metabolites and six peptides were verified to be stepwise regulated in different DKD stages. The altered metabolic pathways and biological processes associated with the DKD pathogenesis were concentrated in amino acid metabolism and cellular protein metabolic process, which were supported by renal transcriptomics. Interestingly, multi-omics significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy for both early DKD diagnosis and DKD status discrimination. Combined with machine learning, a stepwise prediction model was constructed and 89.9% of HC, 75.5% of T2DM, 69.6% of early DKD and 75.7% of overt DKD subjects in the external validation cohort were correctly classified. In addition, 87.5% of grey-zone patients were successfully distinguished from T2DM patients. Conclusion: This multi-omics platform displayed a satisfactory ability to explore molecular information and provided a new insight for establishing effective DKD management.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"Multi-omics; Diabetic kidney disease; Type 2 diabetes; Non-invasive

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA: rs10903323 G/A) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA: rs699947 C/A, rs2010963 G/C, and rs3025039 C/T) contribute to CAD susceptibility. Designs and methods: We examined the association between the four polymorphisms and the risk of CAD in a Chinese population of 435 CAD patients and 480 controls. Genotyping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS). Results: When the MSRA rs10903323 GG homozygous genotype was used as the reference group, the GA and GA/AA genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of CAD (GA vs CC: adjusted OR = 1.36, 95% Cl = 1.02-1.82, p = 0.038; GA/AA vs CC: adjusted OR = 1.33, 95% Cl = 1.01-1.76, p = 0.042). The AA homozygous genotype was not associated with a risk of CAD. In the recessive model, when the MSRA rs10903323 GC/CA genotypes were used as the reference group, the AA homozygous genotype was not associated with a risk of CAD. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the VEGFA rs699947 C/A, VEGFA rs2010963 G/C, and VEGFA rs3025039 C/T polymorphisms were not associated with a risk of CAD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the functional MSRA rs10903323 C/A polymorphism is associated with CAD development. However, our results allow only a preliminary conclusion, which must be validated with a larger study of a more diverse ethnic population. (C) 2013 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

However, hyperprolactinemia was also observed in treatment-naive patients with a first schizophrenic episode. This phenomenon might be related to the role of prolactin as a cytokine in autoimmune diseases. Extrapituitary prolactin production is regulated by an alternative promoter, which contains the functional single nucleotide polymorphism -1149 G/T (rs1341239). We examined whether this polymorphism was associated with hyperprolactinemia in patients with schizophrenia. Method: We recruited 443 patients with schizophrenia and 126 healthy controls. The functional polymorphism -1149 G/T (rs1341239) in the prolactin gene was genotyped with multiplexed primer extension, combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between groups with the chi(2) test and logistic regression models adjusting for covariates. Results: The frequency of genotypes and alleles in patients with schizophrenia did not differ from those in control subjects. A comparison between patients with schizophrenia with and without hyperprolactinemia revealed significantly higher frequency of the G allele in patients with hyperprolactinemia than in patients without it (chi(2) = 7.25; p=0.007; OR=1.44 [1.10-1.89]). Accordingly, patients with hyperprolactinemia carried the GG genotype more frequently than patients without hyperprolactinemia (chi(2) = 9.49; p = 0.009). This association remained significant after adjusting the estimates for such covariates as sex, age, duration of the diseases and the dose of chlorpromazine equivalents. Conclusion: This study revealed a significant association between the polymorphic variant rs1341239 and the development of hyperprolactinemia in patients with schizophrenia. The serum prolactin concentration in patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics may provide an indication of the activity of the gene that regulates extrapituitary prolactin production which is believed to play a role in the immune system.

10.1016/j.canep.2014.09.002,CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY,2014,Association of physical activity and polymorphisms in FGFR2 and DNA methylation related genes with breast cancer risk,"Xi, J","Purpose: Physical activity, a protective factor for breast cancer, increases the level of DNA methylation. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), a confirmed breast cancer susceptibility gene, is predisposed to be methylated. Therefore, DNA methylation related genes, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), together with physical activity and FGFR2, may interact with each other to effect breast cancer risk. Methods: A total of 839 incident breast cancer cases and 863 age-matched controls from Guangzhou, China were included in this study. We used questionnaires to assess physical activity in metabolic equivalent (MET)-h/week/year and a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry platform to ascertain genotypes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from logistic regression models. Results: Exercise activity and FGFR2 rs2981582 were confirmed to be associated with breast cancer risk, and were found to significantly interact (P for multiplicative and additive interactions = 0.045 and 0.021, respectively). Women who had CT/TT genotypes of FGFR2 rs2981582 and experienced exercise activity < 3 MET-h/week/year had significantly increased risk (OR = 3.15, 95% CI = 2.28-4.35) compared to women with CC genotype and >= 3 MET-h/week/year. There was also a significant interaction between FGFR2 rs2981582 and MTHFR rs1801133 on breast cancer risk (P for multiplicative and additive interactions = 0.039 and 0.023, respectively). Conclusion: We found both a gene-environment (FGFR2-exercise activity) and a gene-gene (FGFR2-MTHFR) interaction on breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that environmental factors, such as physical activity, may be able to counteract genetic susceptibility to breast cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have suggested that TCF7L2 rs7903146 was related to the risk of developing NAFLD but the conclusions are not consistent and no related study has been conducted in Chinese populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and the risk of developing NAFLD and CAD in a Chinese Han population. Methods: TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotypes were measured by the MALDI-TOF-MS from 143 NAFLD patients, 159 CAD patients, 131 NAFLD + CAD patients, and 212 healthy controls. The demographic data and serum lipid profiles of all subjects were collected. The distributions of genotype and allele frequency in each group were also tested. Logistic regression was used to investigate the risk of TCF7L2 rs7903146 with NAFLD and CAD. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 23.0. Results: There were no significant differences in the distributions of TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype and allele frequency in each of the two groups, and the TCF7L2 rs7903146 CT + TT genotype did not increase the risk of developing NAFLD, CAD, and NAFLD + CAD.

Although considered relatively rare, several clusters of candidemia due to C rugosa complex had been reported presenting mortality rates close to 70%. In this work we discuss the systematization, phenotyping and molecular methods based on internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequencing and proteomic analyses for species identification, as well as clinical aspects of the C rugosa complex. We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using 72 ITS sequences representative of C rugosa complex isolates and related species within the genus. Biochemical, morphological and MALDI-TOF MS analyses were processed with C rugosa complex type strains and related species isolates. We described that the phylogeny showed four distinct clades inferred with high posterior probabilities, corresponding to the four species within the C. rugosa complex, excluding C. pararugosa. Biochemical and morphological aspects distinguished only C rugosa sensu strict but were not sufficient to accurately identify species within the rest of the complex. Protein spectrum profiles differentiated all reference strains from different species analyzed. To our knowledge, we presented the first phylogenetic analysis using a large collection of ITS sequences as well as proteomic profiles generated from isolates of the C rugosa complex and related species that can enlighten systematics, diagnostics and clinical research fields.

The high incidence of CR-BFG isolated from our hospitalized patients has become an important problem. Therefore, we aimed to determine the frequency and associated factors for intestinal colonization by carbapenem-non-susceptible BFG (CNS-BFG) among adult patients hospitalized at intensive care units, neurosurgery and internal medicine wards in our hospital. Methods: Rectal swabs (n = 1200), collected from 766 patients between February 2014 and March 2015, were inoculated onto kanamycin-vancomycin-leaked blood agar containing 0.125 mg/L meropenem. The isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method. The carbapenemase gene (cfiA) was detected by PCR. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associated factors for intestinal colonization by CNS-BFG. Results: A total 180 non-duplicate BFG isolates were obtained from 164 patients. Ten different species, including Parabacteroides distasonis (n = 46, 25.6%), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 30; 16.6%), were identified. Twenty- five percent of the isolates were non-susceptible to meropenem (MIC >2 mg/L). The highest prevalence of meropenem resistant strains (MIC >8 mg/L) was detected among B. fragilis (n = 12), followed by Parabacteroides spp. (n = 4). All but one B. fragilis strains were cfiA gene positive. Hospital admission, increasing Charlson score, use of antibiotics; including carbapenems in past three months, colonization with other accompanying carbapenem-resistant Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and having undergone surgical operations were significantly associated with RCS- BFG colonization. Conclusions: The high carriage rate of CNS-BFG in hospitalized patients may lead to worse clinical outcomes, such as serious infections and mortality, and deserves attention.",English,gold,Article,"Bacteroides fragilis group; Carbapenem resistance;

However, risk factors contributing to C. auris infection in patients colonized with C. auris remain unclear. Understanding these risk factors is crucial to prevent colonization-to-infection transition and devise effective preventive strategies. This study aimed to investigate risk factors associated with C. auris infection compared to colonization. The study included 97 patients who acquired laboratory-confirmed C. auris in either matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry or VITEK 2 system from October 2019 to June 2023. Baseline demographics and known risk factors associated with C. auris infection were collected from electronic medical records. The infection group had C. auris from a sterile site or non-sterile site with evidence of infection. The colonization group was followed up for a median of 30 days for any signs of infection. Associations between relevant variables and C. auris infection were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The infection group (n = 31) was more likely to be bedbound, with longer hospital stays and more arterial catheters. Chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] 45.070), carriage of multidrug-resistant organisms (OR 64.612), and vasopressor use for > 20 days (OR 68.994) were associated with C. auris infection, after adjusting for sex, age, and prior colonization with C. auris. Chronic kidney disease, carriage of multidrug-resistant organisms, and prolonged vasopressor use emerged as significant risk factors for C. auris infection compared to colonization. They could be used to predict C. auris infection early in patients colonized with C. auris.

The workflow is based on an in situ enrichment on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) plates that were functionalized by TiO2 using automated ion landing apparatus that can operate unsupervised. The MALDI plate can be functionalized by TiO2 into any array of predefined geometry (here, 96 positions for samples and 24 for mass calibration standards) made compatible with a standard MALDI spotter and coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. The in situ MALDI plate enrichment was compared with a standard precolumn-based separation and achieved comparable or better results than the standard method. The performance of this new workflow was demonstrated on a model mixture of proteins as well as on Jurkat cells lysates. The method showed improved signal-to-noise ratio in a single MS spectrum, which resulted in better identification by MS/MS and a subsequent database search. Using the workflow, we also found specific phosphorylations in Jurkat cells that were nonspecifically activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These phosphorylations concerned the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway and its targets and were in agreement with the current knowledge of this signaling cascade. Control sample of non-activated cells was devoid of these phosphorylations. Overall, the presented analytical workflow is able to detect dynamic phosphorylation events in minimally processed mammalian cells while using only a short high-performance liquid chromatography gradient.

We therefore investigated the association between multiple risk alleles and breast cancer risk as well as individual effects according to age-approximated pre- and post-menopausal status. METHODS: Ten previously described breast cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in a joint European biobank-based study comprising 3584 breast cancer cases and 5063 cancer-free controls. Genotyping was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and odds ratios were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Significant associations with breast cancer were confirmed for 7 of the 10 SNPs. Analysis of the joint effect of the original 10 as well as the statistically significant 7 SNPs (rs2981582, rs3803662, rs889312, rs13387042, rs13281615, rs3817198 and rs981782) found a highly significant trend for increasing breast cancer risk with increasing number of risk alleles (P-trend 5.6 x 10(-20) and 1.5 x 10(-25), respectively). Odds ratio for breast cancer of 1.84 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59-2.14; 10 SNPs) and 2.12 (95% CI: 1.80-2.50; 7 SNPs) was seen for the maximum vs the minimum number of risk alleles.

The aims of this study were to investigate the molecular characteristics and risk factors associated with CREC infections. Methods: Bacterial species were identified using the matrix -assisted laser desorption ionization time -of -flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), and the hsp60 gene was utilized for further typing. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were assessed through the MicroScan WalkAway 96 Plus system (Siemens, Germany) and the microbroth dilution method. Antimicrobial resistance genes were screened through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), while the homologous relationship was assessed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Conjugation experiments were performed to verify whether the plasmid could be transferred. Additionally, logistic regression model was employed to analyze risk factors for CREC infections. Results: 32 strains of CREC bacteria were isolated during the study, yet only 20 were retained for preservation. While the isolates demonstrated resistance to the majority of antibiotics, they exhibited high sensitivity to polymyxin B and tigecycline. All isolates carried the bla NDM resistance gene, including 13 bla NDM-1 isolates and 7 bla NDM-5 isolates. MLST homology analysis revealed the presence of seven known ST types and one new ST type. Conjugation experiments confirmed that 13 isolates were capable of transferring the bla NDM resistance gene to Escherichia coli strain EC600. Single -factor analysis identified multiple primary risk factors for CREC infection, but multivariate analysis did not reveal independent risk factors. Conclusion: This study investigates the molecular characteristics and risk factors associated with CREC infections. The detection rate of CREC strains in our hospital is continuously rising and homology analysis suggested that strains might spread in our hospital, emphasizing the importance of implementing effective preventive measures to control the horizontal transmission of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance genes.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,"carbapenem-resistant; Enterobacter cloacae complex; antimicrobial

RTE food samples (n = 204) were aseptically collected and selectively cultured using MacConkey agar. The isolates were screened for ESBL production using the DDST test, confirmed ESBL-E isolates were identified using different conventional methods and MALDI-TOF MS, antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution assay, ESBL-E isolates were analyzed for colistin and ESBL/AmpC encoding genes by PCR, and food samples were analyzed by univariate and multiple logistic regression. Overall, 48 (17.4%) of the 276 Enterobacterales were confirmed as ESBL producers, with a high prevalence in soups (40%), salads (25%), and cream-filled pastries (23.8%). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all the ESBL-E isolates were found multi-drug resistant. PCR revealed that bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(CMY-2), bla(OXA-1), and bla(SHV) were the most frequently detected. bla(CTX-M-9) and bla(CTX-M-1) were the predominant CTX-M types. Furthermore, four isolates were positive for mcr-1; three of them harbored the colistin resistance gene and ESBL/AmpC genes (2 E. cloacae and 1 S. enterica). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that detects the presence of the mcr-1 gene in ESBL-E strains isolated from RTE foods in Algeria.

An MPO G463A polymorphism exists in the promoter region, with the variant A allele conferring lower transcription activity than the common G allele. Because oxidative stress may play a role in breast carcinogenesis, we evaluated MPO genotypes in relation to breast cancer risk among 1,011 cases and 1,067 controls from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (19961997). We also assessed the potential modifying effects of dietary antioxidants and hormonally related risk factors on these relationships. Women over 20 years with incident breast cancer who were residents of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, NY, were identified as potential cases. Population-based controls were frequency matched by 5-year age groups. Genotyping was performed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) technology, and suspected breast cancer risk factors and usual dietary intake were assessed during an in-person interview. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Having at least one A allele was associated with an overall 13% reduction in breast cancer risk. When consumption of fruits and vegetables and specific dietary antioxidants were dichotomized at the median, inverse associations with either GA or AA genotypes were most pronounced among women who consumed higher amounts of total fruits and vegetables (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.97); this association was not noted among the low-consumption group (P for interaction = 0.04). Relationships were strongest among premenopausal women. Results from this first study of MPO genotypes and breast cancer risk indicate that MPO variants, related to reduced generation of ROS, are associated with decreased breast cancer risk, and emphasize the importance of fruit and vegetable consumption in reduction of breast cancer risk.",English,,Article,

We hypothesized that polymorphisms hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 T/C, IRAK1 rs3027898 C/A and RANKL rs7984870 C/G might contribute to CAD susceptibility. Methods: We studied the association between the three polymorphisms and the risk of CAD in a Chinese population using 435 CAD patients and 480 controls. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to perform the genotyping, and the differences were analysed. Results: When the hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 TT homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the TC, CC or TC/CC genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of CAD [TC vs. TT: adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.94, p = 0.04; CC vs. TT: adjusted OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.77-5.56, p < 0.001; CC/TC vs. TT: adjusted OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.25-2.26, p < 0.001). In the recessive model, when the hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 TT/TC genotypes were used as the reference group, the CC homozygote genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CAD (adjusted OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.63-5.04, p < 0.001). Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking and low high-density ipoprotein cholesterol (I-IDL-c) were also associated with a significantly increased risk for CAD. Logistic regression analyses revealed that IRAK1 rs3027898 C/A and RANKL rs7984870 C/G polymorphisms were not associated with risk of CAD.

Out of a total of 446 spots, 170 were specific to either of the two parents, and 276 were common to both. Preliminary analysis, which was performed on 80 progenies (Amiour et al. 2002a), was completed here using a total of 101 selfed lines. Seventy two Loci of amphiphilic spots placed at LOD = 5 were conclusively assigned to15 chromosomes. Some spots mapped during the first analysis were eliminated because of the significant distortion segregation observed in the second analysis. Group-1 chromosomes had by far the greatest number of mapped spots (51). Using the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) approach, analysis of the quantitative variation of each spot revealed that 96 spots out of the 170 specific ones showed at least one Protein Quantity Locus (PQL). These PQLs were distributed throughout the genome. With Matrix Laser Desorption Ionisation Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry and Database interrogation, a total of 93 specific and 41 common spots were identified. This enabled us to show that the majority of these proteins are associated with membranes and/or play a role in plant defence against external invasions.

The methodology of immunoproteomics plays a major role in identifying possible vaccine candidates that could protect against pathogenic infection. The study of immunogenic proteins that are expressed during the outset of infection is the focus of the cross-talk between proteomics and immune protection antigens utilizing serum. Peptide presentation by MHC provides the new 'window' into changes that occur in the cell. Thus, there is strong, intense pressure on the pathogen that has been mutated in such an unusual manner that it can bypass the MHC peptide presentation by the MHC molecule. The pathogen's ability to evade the immune system is strongly restricted by the two unique distinct properties of MHC molecules, i.e., polygenic and polymorphic properties. MHC-I restriction epitope identification has traditionally been accomplished using genetic motif prediction. The study of immune system proteins and their interactions is the main emphasis of the specialist field of immunoproteomics within proteomics. Methodologies include mass spectrometry (MS), SRM assay, MALDI-TOF, Chromatography, ELISA, 2DG PAGE, and bioinformatics tools. Challenges are the complexity of the immune system, protein abundance and dynamics, sample variability, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and data integration. Current advancements are enhanced mass spectrometry techniques, single-cell proteomics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, advanced protein labeling techniques, integration with other omics technologies, and functional proteomics. However, the recently emerging field of immunoproteomics has more promising possibilities in the field of peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particle vaccines. The importance of immunoproteomics technologies and methodologies, as well as their use in the field of vaccinomics, are the main topics of this review.

In order to identify the major genes or proteins involved in muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, three pairs of full-sib pigs with extreme muscle mass difference from Canadian large White were selected as experimental animals at 3 months age. The phenotypic differences of longissimus dorsi muscles (ID) were investigated with microarray and proteomics (2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS), and results were verified by real-time PCR and western bolting respectively. The gene expressing profiling identified 57 and 260 and 147 differently expressed genes (DEGs) from the three pairs respectively with Bayesian statistics and significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) (p <0.05, q <0.05, fold > 2). From the network of these DEGs, some major genes were displayed, such as EGF, PPARG, FN1, SERPINE1, MYC, JUN, involved in Wnt, MAPK and TGF-beta signal pathway respectively, which mainly participated in cell differentiation and proliferation. In parallel, proteomics analyses revealed 50 differently expressed protein (DEP) spots with mass spectrum, and 33 spots of them were found annotated, which took part in energy metabolism and the structure and contraction of muscle fiber.

In addition, the sex- and age-adjusted incidence of PTC has exhibited a greater increase over the last 2 decades than in many other malignancies. Thus, discovering noninvasive specific serum biomarker to distinguish PTC from cancerfree controls in its early stages remains an important goal. Material/Methods: Serum samples from 88 PTC patients and 80 cancer-free controls were randomly allocated into training or validation sets. Serum peptide profiling was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) after using weak cation exchange magnetic beads (WCX-MB), and the results were evaluated by use of ClinProTools (TM) Software. To distinguish PTC from cancer-free controls, quick classifier (QC), supervised neural network (SNN), and genetic algorithm (GA) models were established. The models were blindly validated to verify their diagnostic capabilities. The most discriminative peaks were subsequently identified with a nano-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system. Results: Six peptide ions were identified as the most discriminative peaks between the PTC and cancer-free control samples. The QC model exhibited satisfactory sensitivity and specificity among the 3 models that were validated. Two peaks, at m/z 2671.17 and m/z 1464.68, were identified as fragments of the alpha chain of fibrinogen, while a peak at m/z 1738.92 was a fragment of complement component 4A/B. Conclusions: MS combined with ClinProTools (TM) software was able to detect peptide biomarkers in PTC patients. In addition, the constructed classification models provided a serum peptidome pattern for distinguishing PTC from cancerfree controls.

To improve the embedding of silica nanoparticles within the acrylate matrix the filler surface was modified by trialkoxysilanes. Instead of an expected monomeric silane grafting polysiloxane structures were anchored on the nanoparticle surface due to acid catalyzed pre-hydrolysis/condensation of trialkoxysilanes. The polysiloxanes structures covering the silica surface were characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation, infrared and multinuclear MAS NMR spectroscopy. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy revealed the formation of polysiloxane oligomers with more than 20 monomeric silane units. Ladder-like polysiloxane chains have been proposed and atomic force microscopy were used to visualize the structure of surface-anchored organosilanes. These ladder-like structures are assumed to build up a short range interpenetrating network with polyacrylate chains during UV or EB curing. Due to the organophilic modification of silica nanoparticles reinforced acrylate formulations can contain up to 50 wt.-% nanofiller maintaining satisfactory rheological properties. These formulations can be used as coatings on substrates such as polymer films, paper, metal, wood, engineered wood, etc. After UV/EB curing nanoparticle reinforced polyacrylate coatings are obtained which show markedly improved properties as compared to neat polymers, e.g., increased microhardness and modulus, improved scratch and abrasion resistance, higher gas barriers and temperature resistance. Due to the nano-sized silica filler the cured coatings remain transparent, hazeless and glossy.

To investigate the components of the neuromodulators and how they are distributed in such a system is essential to understand the underlying mechanism. In this study, in situ mass spectrometry based techniques were employed to fulfill this goal. METHODSOffline high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) to analyze the neuropeptides in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) tissue extract from the Jonah crab Cancer borealis. Direct tissue analysis was employed to investigate the neuropeptides present in the STNS. MALDI imaging was also applied to map the localization of multiple neuropeptide families in the STG and the upstream nerve fibers. RESULTSFifty-seven neuropeptides were detected from a single desheathed STG using direct tissue analysis, and they were from eleven different neuropeptide families, including FaRP, AST-A, AST-B, etc. Differential neuropeptide profiles from three different types of ganglia and two types of nerve fiber tissues from the STNS were documented. The direct tissue analysis was shown better for studying neuropeptides from small neural organs like the STG as compared to the large-scale HPLC/MALDI analysis. MALDI images were also acquired to study the distribution of neuropeptides in the STG. CONCLUSIONSIn this study, the components and distribution of neuropeptides have been analyzed in the STNS from C. borealis using direct tissue profiling and MALDI imaging. The results show that the direct tissue analysis of desheathed neural tissues can provide higher sensitivity for neuropeptide study compared to large-scale HPLC/MALDI analysis of pooled tissues. The results are valuable for understanding the functions of neuropeptides in neural network generation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",English,"Bronze, Green Accepted",Article,

This is the first report including results of the research, in which the structure of grains containing different amount of protein was tested to explain this difference. The endosperm was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The structure of the alcurone layer, storing large quantities of protein, did not differ between the high- and low-protein forms of barley. It has been proven that the large quantities of kernel protein may be stored in some cells of the zone adjacent to the aleurone layer, defined as the subaleurone cells. It has been shown that morphologically uniform kernels of the same plant and even of the same ear can vary greatly with respect to the number of these subalcurone cells. The purpose of the study was an examination of variation in protein structure in single kernels of a fodder, a brewery and in an extra high-protein form of barley as well. Moreover the studies were aimed to detect qualitative differences in the subaleurone protein. Application of mass spectrometry made possible the identification of several kinds of proteins which were present in subaleurne layer of kernels. In the granule-bound protein fraction isolated from the subaleurone type kernels, a much stronger representation of some protein was found, with the molecular mass between 29 and 45 kDa, in comparison with the low-protein kernels. It is supposed, that these protein are isoforms of z-type serpin and B3-hordein.",English,,Article,"Hordeum vulgare L; endosperm; subaleurone cells; protein content; starch

As just one group of methylation markers was suitable to extract CIMP+/CIMP-high, and had been commonly used in the ""one-panel method"", it had been unclear whether another cluster of CRC with DNA methylation accumulation exists in microsatellite-stable CRC. We therefore epigenotyped CRC by a comprehensive approach, that is, the two-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering method using highly quantitative methylation data by a single detection method, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, on novel regions selected genome-widely through methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on array analysis. CRC was clearly clustered into three DNA methylation epigenotypes, high-, intermediate- and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME, respectively). Methylation markers are clustered into two distinct groups: Group-1 methylated specifically in HME and including most reported CIMP-related markers; and Group-2 methylated both in HME and IME. While suitable markers to detect a subgroup of CRC with intermediate methylation and correlation to KRAS mutation have been expected to be developed, our data indicated that a ""two-panel method"" is necessary to properly classify CRC into three epigenotypes, the first panel to extract HME using Group-1 markers, and the second panel to divide the remaining into IME and LME using Group-2 markers. Here we review and compare our recent study and reported CRC classification methods by DNA methylation information, and propose the use of two panels of methylation markers as CRC classifiers.

Ninety percent of the spots were common between the very distantly related cultivars 'Opata 85' and 'Synthetic W7984', the two parents of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) progeny. 'Opata' had 130 specific spots while 'Synthetic' had 96. 2DE and image analysis of the soluble proteins present in 112 recombinant inbred lines of the F9-mapped ITMI progeny enabled 120 unbiased segregating spots to be mapped on 21 wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em.

We have examined the phosphorylation of the HMGB proteins from the monocotyledonous plant maize and the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis by protein kinase CK2alpha. Maize CK2alpha phosphorylates the maize HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins and the Arabidopsis HMGB1, HMGB2/3, and HMGB4 proteins. Maize HMGB4 and HMGB5 and Arabidopsis HMGB5 are not phosphorylated by CK2alpha. Depending on the HMGB protein up to five amino acid residues are phosphorylated in the course of the phosphorylation reaction. The HMGB1 proteins from both plants are markedly more slowly phosphorylated by CK2alpha than the other HMGB substrate proteins, indicating that certain HMGB proteins are clearly preferred substrates for CK2alpha. The rate of the phosphorylation reaction appears to be related to the ease of interaction between CK2alpha and the HMGB proteins, as indicated by chemical cross-linking experiments. MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HMGB I and HMGB2/3 proteins occur in various phosphorylation states in immature maize kernels. Thus, HMGB I exists as monophosphorylated, double-phosphorylated, triple-phosphorylated, and tetraphosphorylated protein in kernel tissue, and the tetraphosphorylated form is the most abundant version. The observed in vivo phosphorylation states indicate that protein kinase(s) other than CK2alpha contribute(s) to the modification of the plant HMGB proteins. The fact that the HMGB proteins are phosphorylated to various extents reveals that the existence of differentially modified forms increases the number of distinct HMGB protein variants in plant chromatin that may be adapted to certain functions.",English,,Article,

This study included 563 12-month-old infants in the HealthNuts population-based study. DNA from participants' blood samples was genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY MALDI-TOF system on 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes. Using logistic regression, we examined associations between environmental exposure and SNPs in vitamin D pathway and filaggrin genes and vitamin D insufficiency (VDI). VDI, defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3(25(OH)D3) level <= 50 nmol/L, was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Infants were stratified by ethnicity determined by parent's country of birth. Infants formula fed at 12 months were associated with reduced odds of VDI compared to infants with no current formula use at 12 months. This association differed by ethnicity (P-interaction = 0.01). The odds ratio (OR) of VDI was 0.29 for Caucasian infants (95% CI, 0.18-0.47) and 0.04 for Asian infants (95% CI, 0.006-0.23). Maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding were associated with increased odds of infants being VDI (OR, 2.39; 95% Cl, 1.11-5.18 and OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.20-5.24 respectively). Presence of a minor allele for any GC SNP (rs17467825, rs1155563, rs2282679, rs3755967, rs4588, rs7041) was associated with increased odds of VDI. Caucasian infants homozygous (AA) for rs4588 had an OR of 2.49 of being associated with VDI (95% CI, 1.19-5.18). In a country without routine infant vitamin D supplementation or food chain fortification, formula use is strongly associated with a reduced risk of VDI regardless of ethnicity.

A large numbers of genetic association studies have confirmed that the HCRTR2 (Hypocretin Receptor 2) SNP rs2653349, and the ADH4 (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 4) SNP rs1126671 and rs1800759 polymorphisms are linked to CH. In addition, the CLOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) gene is becoming a research hotspot for CH due to encoding a transcription factor that serves as a basic driving force for circadian rhythm in humans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between CH and the HCRTR2, ADH4 and CLOCK genes in a Chinese CH case-control sample. Methods: We genotyped polymorphisms of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HCRTR2, ADH4 and CLOCK genes to perform an association study on a Chinese Han CH case-control sample (112 patients and 192 controls), using Sequenom MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry iPLEX platform. The frequencies and distributions of genotypes and haplotypes were statistically compared between the case and control groups to identify associations with CH. The effects of SNPs on CH were further investigated by multiple logistic regression. Results: The frequency of the HCRTR2 SNP rs3800539 GA genotype was significantly higher in cases than in controls (48.2% vs. 37.0%). The GA genotypes was associated with a higher CH risk (OR = 1.483, 95% CI: 0.564-3.387, p = 0.038), however, after Bonferroni correction, the association lost statistical significance. Haplotype analysis of the HCRTR2 SNPs showed that among eight haplotypes, only H1-GTGGGG was linked to a reduced CH risk (44.7% vs. 53.1%, OR = 0.689, 95% CI = 0.491 similar to 0.966, p = 0.030). No significant association of ADH4, CLOCK SNPs with CH was statistically detected in the present study. Conclusions: Association between HCRTR2, ADH4, CLOCK gene polymorphisms and CH was not significant in the present study, however, haplotype analysis indicated H1-GTGGGG was linked to a reduced CH risk.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,Cluster headache; Gene polymorphism; HCRTR2; ADH4; Clock

Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs280520, rs91755, rs2304256, rs12720270, rs280519 located within TYK2 gene were selected and MassARRAY (R) MALDI-TOF system was employed for genotyping. SPSS 19.0 was adopted for statistical analysis, non-conditional logistic regression was conducted. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed to estimate their contributions to PTB incidence. Results: In the overall study population, rs91755 TT and rs280519 AA genotypes were found to be associated with reduced PTB risk (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16-0.72; OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.18-0.79, respectively). After stratification for sex, we found that among the male population, rs91755TG/TT, rs12720270AG/GG and rs280519AG/AA genotypes were associated with reduced PTB risk (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.21-0.80; OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.94; OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.82, respectively).

10.3390/cancers12113295,CANCERS,2020,Liver Cirrhosis in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients Is Associated with Genetic Variations in DNA Repair Pathway Genes,"Rybicka, M","Simple Summary As DNA repair enzymes affect dynamics of liver damage and are involved in HBV viral replication, this study focused on the role of genetic variations within genes representing key DNA-repair pathways in HBV-induced liver cirrhosis. The obtained results have demonstrated that SNPs within XRCC1, ERCC2 genes may confer susceptibility to liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B patients. Liver cirrhosis (LC), contributing to more than 1 million of deaths annually, is a major healthcare concern worldwide. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major LC etiological factor, and 15% of patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB) develop LC within 5 years. Recently, novel host genetic determinants were shown to influence HBV lifecycle and CHB course. DNA repair enzymes can affect dynamics of liver damage and are involved in HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) formation, an essential step for viral replication. This study aimed to evaluate the possible role of genes representing key DNA-repair pathways in HBV-induced liver damage. MALDI-TOF MS genotyping platform was applied to evaluate variations within XRCC1, XRCC4, ERCC2, ERCC5, RAD52, Mre11, and NBN genes. Apart from older age (p < 0.001), female sex (p = 0.021), portal hypertension (p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (p < 0.001), high HBV DNA (p = 0.001), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p < 0.001), we found that G allele at rs238406 (ERCC2, p = 0.025), T allele at rs25487 (XRCC1, p = 0.012), rs13181 GG genotype (ERCC2, p = 0.034), and C allele at rs2735383 (NBN, p = 0.042) were also LC risk factors. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that rs25487 CC (p = 0.005) and rs238406 TT (p = 0.027) were independently associated with lower risk of LC.

Farm visits were performed monthly including sterile quarter milk sampling and udder evaluation of all lactating cows. Milk samples were evaluated for the presence of staphylococci using selective agar plates. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Intramammary infection was defined as milk samples having >= 100 cfu per mL of milk according to culture results. Overall, 3,151 quarter samples were included in the statistical analysis. Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and a Staphylococcus warneri-like species were the 4 most prevalent CNS species found. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were built to evaluate risk factors for species -specific CNS IMI. Risk factors for Staph. chromogenes IMI were presence in herd B, the period from June 2014 to August 2014 and December 2014 to February 2015, and presence of udder edema. For Staph. haemolyticus, the relevant risk factor included coinfection with Staph. xylosus coinfection with other than the above-mentioned CNS species (""others"") and the period from June 2014 to November 2014. Coinfection with Staph. haemolyticus and ""others,"" the periods from June 2014 to August 2014 and December 2014 to February 2015, early phase of lactation (1-60 d in milk), and belonging to herd B were significantly associated with Staph. xylosus IMI. Mid and late lactation, coinfection with Staph. xylosus, and the period September 2014 to May 2015 were identified as significant risk factors for Staph. warneri-like IMI. For Staph. chro-mogenes, 60.6 and 26% of the variance was observed at the quarter and cow level, respectively, whereas for the other investigated species the highest variance was observed at the sample level.

Recently, the APE1/Ref-1 promoter -141T/G variant (rs1760944) has been reported to be associated with lung cancer risk. Given the importance of APE1/Ref-1 in both DNA repair and redox activity, we speculate that the -141T/G polymorphism may confer individual susceptibility to gliomas or its subtypes. Methods: The APE1/Ref-1 -141T/G polymorphism was analyzed in a case-control study including 766 glioma patients (among them 241 glioblastoma, 284 astrocytomas except for glioblastoma and 241 other gliomas) and 824 cancer-free controls from eastern China. Genotyping was performed with Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform by use of allele-specific MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. A test of trend was calculated using the genotype as an ordinal variable in the regression model. For each statistically significant association identified, we estimated the false positive reporting probability (FPRP). FPRP values less than 0.2 were consider to indicate robust associations. Results: The significant association between the APE1/Ref-1 promoter -141T/G polymorphism and glioma risk was not observed. However, the stratified analysis by histology revealed the variant allele G significantly decreased glioblastoma risk (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.98, P = 0.032). Individuals with the homozygous -141GG genotype exhibited 46% reduced risk of glioblastoma (adjusted OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.87, P = 0.012), compared with the TT homozygote. This result remained robust given the prior probabilities of 25% (FPRP = 0.052) and 10% (FPRP = 0.140), but not with a prior probability of 1% (FPRP = 0.643). The P-associated with the trend test was 0.014. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a specific genetic variant located in the APE1/Ref-1 promoter may modulate risk of glioblastoma, but not for other histological gliomas. Larger studies with more APE1 polymorphisms are required to validate these preliminary findings.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,

Despite a relatively high mortality rate, there are limited data regarding the risk factors of this life-threatening infection. Therefore, a 13-year retrospective cohort study in Chiang Mai, Thailand during 2005-2018 was conducted to explore risk factors associated with S. suis mortality and to update the outcomes of the disease. Patients and methods: S. suis positive cases were derived from those with positive S. suis isolates from microbiological culture results and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Potential risk factors of mortality were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 133 patients with culture-proven S. suis infection identified, there were 92 males and 41 females. The mean age was 56.47 years. Septicemia (55.64%) was the most common clinical manifestation followed by meningitis (37.59%) and infective endocarditis (25.56%). Alcohol drinking and raw pork consumption were documented in 66 (49.62%) and 49 (36.84%) cases respectively. The overall mortality rate was 12.03% (n=16). According to the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for mortality were prolonged bacteremia >= 6 days (OR = 43.57, 95% CI = 2.46-772.80, P =0.010), septic shock (OR = 13.34, 95% CI = 1.63-109.03, P =0.016), and direct bilirubin > 1.5 mg/dL (OR = 12.86, 95% CI = 1.91-86.59, P =0.009). Conclusion: S. suis is not infrequent in Northern Thailand, where the cultural food habit of raw pork eating is still practiced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series focusing on risk factors of S. suis mortality which has been conducted in Thailand. Prolonged bacteremia >= 6 days, septic shock, and direct bilirubin > 1.5 mg/dL were strong predictors associated with S. suis mortality. The mortality risk factors identified may be further utilized in clinical practice and future research to improve patient outcomes.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"Streptococcus suis; S. suis; risk factor; S. suis infection; mortality;

This study aimed to identify the serum biomarkers of HSP in children. Experimental design: We performed proteomic analysis of serum samples from 38 paired pre-and posttherapy HSP patients and 22 healthy controls using a combination of magnetic bead-based weak cation exchange and MALDI-TOF MS. ClinProTools was used to screen the differential peaks. Then, LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed to identify the proteins. ELISA was used to verify the expression of whole protein in the serum of 92 HSP patients, 14 peptic ulcer disease (PUD) patients and 38 healthy controls, which were prospectively collected. Finally, logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the diagnostic value of the above predictors and existing clinical indicators. Results: Seven potential HSP serum biomarker peaks (m/z:1228.95, m/z:1781.22, m/z:1468.43, m/z:1619.53, m/z:1868.41, m/z:1694.05, m/z:1743.25) with higher expression in the pretherapy group and one peak (m/ z:1947.41) with lower expression in the pretherapy group were all identified as peptide regions of albumin (ALB), complement C4-A precursor (C4A), tubulin beta chain (TUBB), isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), and ezrin (EZR). The expression of identified proteins was validated by ELISA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum C4A EZR and ALB were independent risk factors for HSP, serum C4A and lgA were independent risk factors for HSPN, and serum D-dimer was an independent risk factor for abdominal HSP. Conclusions and clinical relevance: These findings revealed the specific etiology of HSP from the perspective of serum proteomics. The identified proteins might serve as potential biomarkers for HSP and HSPN diagnoses. Significance: Henoch-Scho spacing diaeresis nlein purpura (HSP) is the most common systemic vasculitis in children, and its diagnosis depends primarily on characteristic skin changes. Early diagnosis of non-rash patients is difficult, especially for abdominal and renal types (Henoch-Scho spacing diaeresis nlein purpura nephritis, HSPN). HSPN has poor outcomes, is diagnosed based on urinary protein and/or haematuria, and cannot be detected early in HSP. Patients with an earlier diagnosis of HSPN appear to have better renal outcomes. Our plasma proteomic analysis of HSP in children revealed that HSP patients could be distinguished from healthy controls and peptic ulcer disease pa-tients using complement C4-A precursor (C4A), ezrin, and albumin. C4A and IgA could distinguish HSPN from HSP in the early stages, and D-dimer was a sensitive index used to distinguish abdominal HSP; identifying these biomarkers could promote the early diagnosis of HSP, especially pediatric HSPN and abdominal HSP, thereby improving precision therapy.",English,hybrid,Article,"Early diagnosis; Henoch-Scho?nlein purpura; Mass spectrometry; Serum

It contains micronutrients, vitamins, antioxidants and fibre, and can greatly increase the nutritional quality of flour if it is not removed from the kernel with the bran. The AL of mature kernels of three varieties of the two major cultivated wheat species T. aestivum (genome A, B and D) and T. monococcum (genome A) were manually dissected and analyzed using two-dimensional gel-based proteomics. In T. monococcum although composed of only genome A, the maximum number of Coomassie stained AL spots was close to the number found in the bread wheat varieties (1320 and 1258, respectively). Inter-variety variation in spots was higher in the three T. monococcum varieties (103 spots) than in the three T. aestivum varieties (79 spots). Comparison of the two species revealed that only 88 spots differed significantly either in abundance or presence/absence. The B and D genome did not drastically modify the AL proteome, as demonstrated by the fact that 93% of the spots present in T. Monococcum AL spots were also present in T. aestivum. Proteins which differed within and between species were identified using MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS Mass Spectrometry. Among the 182 spots that differed, 115 were identified, 53 differed between the two species and 44 (83%) were globulin (Glo) storage proteins. The remarkable environmental stability of the AL proteome previously observed in T. durum and T. aestivum species was confirmed in the variety T. monococcum DV92, grown for two consecutive years in field conditions. Only 15 proteins (out of 1320 AL spots) exhibited significant quantitative variations.",English,,Article,Aleurone layer; globulins; metabolic pathway; wheat species

However, obtaining tumor tissue for mutation analysis is challenging. Here, we aimed to detect serum peptides/proteins associated with EGFR gene mutation status, and test whether a classification algorithm based on serum proteomic profiling could be developed to analyze EGFR gene mutation status to aid therapeutic decision-making. Patients and Methods Serum collected from 223 stage IIIB or IV NSCLC patients with known EGFR gene mutation status in their tumors prior to therapy was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and ClinProTools software. Differences in serum peptides/proteins between patients with EGFR gene TKI-sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR genes were detected in a training group of 100 patients; based on this analysis, a serum proteomic classification algorithm was developed to classify EGFR gene mutation status and tested in an independent validation group of 123 patients. The correlation between EGFR gene mutation status, as identified with the serum proteomic classifier and response to EGFR-TKIs was analyzed. Results Nine peptide/protein peaks were significantly different between NSCLC patients with EGFR gene TKI-sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR genes in the training group. A genetic algorithm model consisting of five peptides/proteins (m/z 4092.4, 4585.05, 1365.1, 4643.49 and 4438.43) was developed from the training group to separate patients with EGFR gene TKI-sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR genes. The classifier exhibited a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 77.5% in the validation group. In the 81 patients from the validation group treated with EGFR-TKIs, 28 (59.6%) of 47 patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""mutant"" by the classifier and 3 (8.8%) of 34 patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""wild"" achieved an objective response (p<0.0001). Patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""mutant"" by the classifier had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""wild"" (p=0.001). Conclusion Peptides/proteins related to EGFR gene mutation status were found in the serum. Classification of EGFR gene mutation status using the serum proteomic classifier established in the present study in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC is feasible and may predict tumor response to EGFR-TKIs.",English,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",Article,

Here, we aimed to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the untranslated regions of the EGLN1 and HIF-1AN genes and SNPs chosen from a genome-wide adaptation study of the Han Chinese population. To assess the association between EGLN1 and HIF-1AN SNPs and AMS in a Han Chinese population, a case-control study was performed including 190 patients and 190 controls. In total, thirteen SNPs were genotyped using the MassARRAY (R) MALDI-TOF system. Multiple genetic models were tested; The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values indicated that the dominant model may serve as the best-fit model for rs12406290 and rs2153364 of significant difference. However, these data were not significant after Bonferroni correction. No significant association was noted between AMS and rs12757362, rs1339894, rs1361384, rs2009873, rs2739513 or rs2486729 before and after Bonferroni correction. Further haplotype analyses indicated the presence of two blocks in EGLN1; one block consists of rs12406290-rs2153364, located upstream of the EGLN1 gene. Carriers of the ""GG"" haplotype of rs12406290-rs2153364 exhibited an increased risk of AMS after adjustments for age and smoking status.

METHODS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used to characterize the serum peptide profile of HCC patients with bone metastasis. Serum samples from 138 HCC patients (66 cases with and 72 cases without bone metastasis) were randomly assigned into a training set (n = 76) and a test set (n = 62). Differential serum peptides were examined using ClinProt magnetic bead-based purification followed by MALDITOF-MS. The sequences of differentially expressed serum peptides were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A diagnostic model was established using a learning algorithm of radial basis function neural network verified by a single blind trial. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic power of the established model. RESULTS: Ten peptide peaks were significantly different between HCC patients with or without bone metastasis (P < 0.001). Sequences of seven peptides with mass to charge ratios (m/z) of 1780.7, 1866.5, 2131.6, 2880.4, 1532.4, 2489.8, and 2234.3 were successfully identified. These seven peptides were derived from alpha-fetoprotein, prothrombin, serglycin, isoform 2 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, isoform 1 of autophagy-related protein 16-2, and transthyretin and fibrinogen beta chains, respectively. The recognition rate and predictive power of a diagnostic model established on the basis of six significant peptides (m/z for these six peptides were 1535.4, 1780.7, 1866.5, 2131.6, 2880.4, and 2901.9) were 89.47% and 82.89%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this model based upon a single blind trial were 85.29% and 85.71%, respectively. ROC analysis found that the AUC (area under the ROC curve) value was 0.911.

Herein, three HP-beta-CD/GSE inclusion complexes with host-guest ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 were successfully prepared by co-precipitation method to improve stability. Successful embedding of GSE in the HP-beta-CD cavity was confirmed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The Autodock Tools 1.5.6 was used to simulate the three-dimensional supramolecular structure of the inclusion complex of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and grape seed extract (HP-beta-CD/GSE) by molecular docking. The MALDI-TOF-MS technology and chemical database Pubchem, and structural database PDB were combined to reconstitute the three-dimensional structure of target protein. The binding mode of the HP-beta-CD/GSE inclusion complex to target protein was studied at the molecular level, and the antioxidant ability of the resulting HP-beta-CD/GSE inclusion complexes was investigated by measuring 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging. The effects of HP-beta-CD/GSE on myofibrillar protein from lamb tripe were also investigated under oxidative conditions. The positions and interactions of the binding sites of HP-beta-CD/GSE inclusion complexes and target protein receptors were simulated by molecular docking. The results showed that HP-beta-CD/GSE inclusion complexes were successfully prepared, optimally at a molar ratio of 1:2. At low (5 mu mol/g) to medium (105 mu mol/g) concentrations, HP-beta-CD/GSE inclusion complexes decreased the carbonyl content, hydrophobicity, and protein aggregation of myofibrillar protein from lamb tripe, and increased the sulphydryl content.

Irradiation was performed with a diode laser with a wavelength of lambda = 810, operating mode: 25 W/15.000 Hz/10 mu s, average = 3.84 W with the number of repetitions t = 2 x 15 s and t = 3 x 15 s. The structure and surface roughness of the implants were analysed before and after laser irradiation by optical profilometry and optical microscopy with confocal fixation. In total, 16 species of Gram-positive bacteria and 23 species of Gram-negative bacteria were identified on the surface of the implants. A total of 25 species of anaerobic bacteria and 12 species with corrosive potential were detected. After diode laser irradiation, the reduction in bacteria on the implants ranged from 88.85% to 100%, and the reduction in fungi from 87.75% to 96.77%. The reduction in microorganisms in the abutment was greater than in the endosseous fixture. The applied laser doses did not damage, but only cleaned the surface of the titanium implants. After 8 years of embedding, the removed titanium implant showed greater roughness than the 25-year-old implant, which was not exposed to direct influence of the oral cavity environment. The use of a diode laser in an optimised irradiation dose safely reduces the number of microorganisms identified on corroded dental implants in patients with peri-implantitis.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,"titanium implant; oral microbiome; diode laser; peri-implantitis;

Therefore, it is important to regularly measure the extent of UTIs and ABR in the most susceptible populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of UTIs, associated factors, bacterial causal agents, and their antibiotic susceptibility profile among PLHIV in central Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit 688 PLHIV by a simple random sampling method. Background information was gathered through interviews, while clinical information was gathered from recent information sheets of patient charts using organized, pretested, and validated study tools. Midstream urine was collected aseptically and transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology within 4 h of collection, maintaining its cold chain. Standard conventional microbial culture methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were used to identify the bacterial isolates at the species level. Kirby Bauer's disk diffusion method was used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacterial isolates based on the interpretation guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. Logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with the occurrence of UTIs among PLHIV attending selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, and Adama. Results: Out of 688 PLHIVs involved in the current study, 144 (20.9%) were positive for UTIs, whereas the majority were asymptomatic for UTIs. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only HIV RNA >= 200 copies/ml [AOR = 12.24 (95% CI, 3.24, 46.20), p < 0.01] and being symptomatic for UTIs during the study period [AOR = 11.57 (95% CI, 5.83, 22.97), p < 0.01] were associated with the occurrence of UTIs. The dominant bacterial species isolated were Escherichia coli (E. coli; n = 65; 43%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis; n = 16; 10.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae; n = 11; 7.3%). Over half of the E. coli isolates were resistant to antibiotics such as gentamicin (GM; n = 44; 67.7%), amikacin (AN; n = 46; 70.8%), nalidixic acid (NA; n = 42; 64.6%), ciprofloxacin (CIP; n = 40; 61.5%), and azithromycin (AZM; n = 45; 69.2%). All of the K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 11; 100%), (n = 6; 54.5%), and (n = 7; 63.6%) were resistant to [amoxicillin as well as amoxicillin + clavulanic acid], ceftriaxone, and sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim, respectively. All the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, which implies methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Conclusion: The high prevalence of UTIs and antibiotic resistance revealed in the current study needs public health interventions such as educating the population about preventive measures and the importance of early treatment of UTIs. Our findings also highlight the need to provide UTI screening services for PLHIV, and healthcare providers should adopt antibiotic stewardship programs to promote and ensure their appropriate and judicious use.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); urinary tract infections (UTIs);

However, studies on drug resistance surveillance of KP, especially MDR KP, with a large longitudinal sample size in a tertiary hospital are rare. This study aims to investigate phenotypic epidemiology characteristics of 4128 KP isolates in a Chinese tertiary hospital covering a period of 5 years. Methods: All the KP clinical isolates were retrospectively collected from a tertiary hospital in Hunan province of China from Jan 5, 2013 to Jul 24, 2018. All the isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Twenty-four antimicrobial agents were tested by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Fisher exact test and logistic regression were used to analyze the association between clinical factors and antimicrobial non-susceptibility for seven secondchoice antimicrobials. Results: A total of 4128 KP isolates were collected in our study. The non-susceptible rates (NSRs) to ertapenem, imipenem and tigecycline increased considerably from 2013 to 2018 (13.6% to 28.6%, 10.1% to 28.9%, 10.8% to 46.5%, respectively) Amikacin presents the lowest NSR among 3 aminoglycosides (3.8-22.8%). The multi-drug NSRs among KP isolates to second-choice antimicrobials (88.6-100%) were higher than to all drugs (68.0%). The NSRs varied significantly among departments and sample sources. Higher ETP/IPM/AK NSRs (39.8/39.7/30.6%) were observed in Intensive Care Unit, and ETP/IPM non-susceptible isolates tended to distribute in cerebrospinal fluid. From 2015 to 2017, the NSRs of ETP, IPM, and AK showed an opposite trend of seasonal fluctuations to SXT. Conclusion: Higher multi-drug resistance (MDR) rates were observed in KP isolates to second-choice antimicrobials than to others, among which MDR rates to carbapenems or AK are the highest. A unique pattern of MX and time distributions of MDR were observed. Clinical factors including gender were correlated with MDR rates of KP. Isolates in ICU and CSF showed higher NSRs in carbapenems which should be paid more attention to, and temporal distribution of NSRs was observed.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,Klebsiella pneumoniae; drug resistance; NSR; phenotypic epidemiology

Results showed novel genetic associations with bone phenotypes and points to the CD80 gene as relevant in postmenopausal bone loss. Introduction Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. However, to date, research into osteoporosis has only been able to explain a small part of its heritability. Moreover, several components of the immune system are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism. Among them, B cells occupy a prominent place. Methods The study consisted of two stages. In the first, gene expression in bone marrow B cells is compared between ovariectomized and SHAM control mice using microarrays. In the second, we studied the association of polymorphisms in some differentially expressed genes (DEG) in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Results The present study has found 2791 DEG (false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%), of which 1569 genes were upregulated (56.2%) and 1122 genes (43.8%) were downregulated. Among the most altered pathways were inflammation, interleukin signaling, B cell activation, TGF-beta signaling, oxidative stress response, and Wnt-signaling. Sixteen DEG were validated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or qPCR. The translational stage of the study genotyped nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DEG or related and detected association with bone mineral density (BMD) (nominal P values), while adjusting for confounders, for SNPs in the CD80, CD86, and HDAC5 genes. In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders, in addition to the SNPs in the aforementioned genes, the SNPs in the MMP9 and SOX4 genes were associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. Finally, two SNPs (in the CD80 and SOX6 genes) were associated with an increased risk of bone fragility fracture (FF). However, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only the association between CD80 with BMD and risk of osteoporosis remained significant. Conclusion These results show that the use of animal models is an appropriate method for identifying genes associated with human bone phenotypes.",English,,Article,"Association studies; Bcells; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomy; Translational

Both clear cell ovarian carcinomas (CCC) and ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (EC) may arise from endometriosis and frequently harbor mutations in the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene. We studied the influence of histological subtype on protein expression with reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and assessed proteomic changes associated with ARID1A mutation/BAF250a expression in EC and CCC. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BAF250a expression was performed on 127 chemotherapy-naive ovarian carcinomas (33 CCC, 29 EC, and 65 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC)). Whole tumor lysates were prepared from frozen banked tumor samples and profiled by RPPA using 116 antibodies. ARID1A mutations were identified by exome sequencing, and PIK3CA mutations were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) was performed to determine differential protein expression by histological subtype and ARID1A mutation status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the impact of ARID1A mutation status/BAF250a expression on AKT phosphorylation (pAKT). PIK3CA mutation type and PTEN expression were included in the model. BAF250a knockdown was performed in 3 clear cell lines using siRNA to ARID1A. Results: Marked differences in protein expression were observed that are driven by histotype. Compared to HGSC, SAM identified over 50 proteins that are differentially expressed in CCC and EC. These included PI3K/AKT pathway proteins, those regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, and other signaling pathways including steroid hormone signaling. Multivariate models showed that tumors with loss of BAF250a expression showed significantly higher levels of AKT-Thr(308) and AKT-Ser(473) phosphorylation (p < 0.05). In 31 CCC cases, pAKT was similarly significantly increased in tumors with BAF250a loss on IHC. Knockdown of BAF250a by siRNA in three CCC cell lines wild type for ARID1A showed no increase in either pAKT-Thr(308) or pAKT-S-473 suggesting that pAKT in tumor tissues is indirectly regulated by BAF250a expression. Conclusions: Proteomic assessment of CCC and EC demonstrates remarkable differences in protein expression that are dependent on histotype, thereby further characterizing these cancers. AKT phosphorylation is associated with ARID1A/BAF250a deficient tumors, however in ovarian cancers the mechanism remains to be elucidated.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,"Ovarian cancer; Proteomics; ARID1A/BAF250a; PIK3CA mutation; AKT;

New biochemical serum markers could be used to advance the diagnosis and prognosis of HBV-associated liver diseases during the progression of chronic hepatitis B into cirrhosis and HCC. We determined whether the 4210 Da and 1866 Da polypeptides are serum metabolite biomarkers of hepatopathy with hepatitis B virus. A total of 570 subjects were divided into five groups: healthy controls, those with natural clearance, and patients with CHB, LC, and HCC. The 1866 Da and 4210 Da polypeptides were measured by Clin-ToF II MALDI-TOF-MS. There were significant differences in 4210 Da and 1866 Da levels among the five groups (P < 0.001). For the differential diagnosis of CHB from normal liver, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 4210 Da and 1866 Da and their combination via logistic regression were 0.961, 0.849 and 0.967. For the differential diagnosis of LC from CHB, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.695, 0.841 and 0.826. For the differential diagnosis of HCC from CHB, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.744, 0.710 and 0.761, respectively. For the differential diagnosis of HCC from LC, the areas under the ROC curve of 4210 Da and 1866 Da were 0.580 and 0.654.

Materials and methods: A total of 317 CHB patients receiving interferon alone for the first time were recruited in northern China, and peripheral blood samples were obtained. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rs155209, rs3781719, rs3754701, and rs7590387 were genotyped using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were employed to assess the correlation between CHB prognosis treated with interferon and polymorphisms of these gene loci. Results: The study clearly demonstrated the relevance of polymorphisms of rs155209, rs3781719, rs3754701, and rs7590387 with DNA response and ALT response after interferon treatment. CHB patients with CGRP rs155209C had a lower risk of developing DNA response (CT vs. TT: OR = 0.159, 95% CI = 0.086-0.294, P-adj < 0.001; CC vs. TT: OR = 0.131, 95% CI = 0.059-0.288, P-adj < 0.001), as well as a lower risk of developing ALT response (CT vs. TT: OR = 0.530, 95% CI = 0.323-0.869, P-adj < 0.05). Moreover, CHB patients with RAMP1 rs3754701T allele were more prone to develop DNA response (AT vs. AA: OR = 2.061, 95% CI = 1.237-3.435, P-adj < 0.05; TT vs. AA: OR = 5.676, 95% CI =1.247-25.837, P-adj < 0.05), and they also more likely to develop ALT response (AT vs. AA: OR = 1.766, 95% CI = 1.098-2.840, P-adj < 0.05). We did not find a significant association between CGRP rs3781719 or RAMP1 rs7590387 and DNA response or ALT response. Conclusion: This study revealed that CGRP rs155209 and RAMP1 rs3754701 polymorphisms, but not CGRP rs3781719 and RAMP1 rs7590387, were correlated with interferon therapy prognosis for CHB in Han Chinese population, and RAMP1 rs3754701T was a protective factor for ALT response and DNA response, but CGRP rs155209C carriers were less prone to DNA and ALT responses.",English,,Article,"Chronic hepatitis B; Interferon; CGRP; RAMP1; Single nucleotide

Solutions of the saponified oils, mixed with the matrix, meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, provided reproducible MALDI-TOF spectra in which the ions were dominated by sodiated sodium carboxylates [RCOONa + Na](+). Thus, palm kernel oil was found to contain capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and stearic acid. Palm oil had a fatty acid profile including palmitic, linoleic, oleic, and stearic. The relative percentages of the fatty acids in olive oil were palmitoleic (1.2 +/- 0.5), palmitic (10.9 +/- 0.8), linoleic (0.6 +/- 0.1), linoleic (16.5 +/- 0.8), and oleic (70.5 +/- 1.2). For soybean oh, the relative percentages were: palmitoleic (0.4 +/- 0.4), palmitic (6.0 +/- 1.3), linolenic (14.5 +/- 1.8), linoleic (50.1 +/- 4.0), oleic (26.1 +/- 1.2), and stearic (2.2 +/- 0.7). This method was also applied to the analysis of two commercial soap formulations. The first soap gave a fatty acid profile that included: lauric (19.4% rt 0.8), myristic (9.6% +/- 0.5), palmitoleic (1.9% +/- 0.3), palmitic (16.3% +/- 0.9), linoleic (5.6% +/- 0.4), oleic (37.1% +/- 0.8), and stearic (10.1% +/- 0.7) and that of the second soap was: lauric (9.3% +/- 0.3), myristic (3.8% +/- 0.5), palmitoleic (3.1% +/- 0.8), palmitic (19.4% +/- 0.8), linoleic (4.9% +/- 0.7), oleic (49.5% +/- 1.1), and stearic (10.0% +/- 0.9). The MALDI-TOFMS method described in this communication is simpler and less time-consuming than the established transesterification method that is coupled with analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The new method, could be used routinely to determine the qualitative fatty acid composition of vegetable oils, and, when fully validated by comparison with standard analytical methodologies, should provide a relatively fast quantitative measurement of fatty acid mixtures and/or soap formulations that contain saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon moieties.

Here, variability among allochthonous Stone pine populations in Chile was explored using electrophoresis-based proteomic analysis of pine nuts. Cones from 30 populations distributed along a climatic gradient in Chile were surveyed and sampled, and proteins were extracted from seed flour using the TCA-acetone precipitation protocol. Extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and 2-DE for protein resolution, gel images captured, and spot or bands intensity quantified and subjected to statistical analysis (ANOVA, unsupervised Hierarchical Analysis Clustering and PLS regression). Protein yield ranged among populations from 161.7 (North populations) to 298.7 (South populations) mg/g dry weight. A total of 50 bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE in the 6.5-200 kDa Mr. range, of which 17 showed quantitative or qualitative differences, with 12 proteins identified. Pine nut extracts from the most distant populations were analyzed by 2-DE and a total of 129 differential spots were observed, out of which 13 were proposed as putative protein markers of variability. Out of the 129 spots, 118 proteins were identified after MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Identified proteins were classified into two principal categories: reserve and stress related. We provide the first protein map of P. pinea nuts. The use of a proteomic approach was useful to detect variability of Stone pine across three Chilean macrozones, with correlations between protein profiles and geoclimatic parameters, suggesting a new approach to study the variability of this species. Biological significance: This study presents the first protein map of Stone pine nuts, relevant for the advancement of protein characterization in pine nuts. Putative protein markers are proposed, evidencing that a proteomic approach may be useful to detect variability of Stone pine across Chilean macrozones, suggesting a new approach to study the variability of this species, which may also be extrapolated to other forest fruit species.",English,,Article,"Allochthonous Stone pine plantations; Pine nut proteomics; Pinus pinea;

All 3 patients underwent thread embedding and weight loss surgery at the same informal beauty institution, with a history of silk protein injection. None of the patients had any other underlying diseases or surgical history. Symptoms and signs show that the disease is acute and the course of the disease is short. All patients have found subcutaneous masses in different parts of the body. In most cases, the masses show redness and swelling, and some of the masses are accompanied by tenderness, wave sensation, and rupture. After some of the masses rupture, purulent secretions can be seen. Methods: The pus secreted by the skin lesions of the three patients were cultured to a single bacterium, which was identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Multiple locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed using three specific genes ( hsp65 , rpoB , and secA1) and seven housekeeping genes ( argH , cya , glpK , gnd, murC , pta , and purH ). The results were queried through the MLST database of Mycobacterium abscess . Results: All three strains of bacteria were Mycobacterium abscess type ST279 massiliense subtype. Three antibacterial drugs including cefmetazole, amikacin, and clarithromycin were administered in combination with 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA -PDT). After 3 - 6 months, there was no obvious redness or swelling in the surrounding tissues of the wound, and no obvious purulent secretions were observed. All patients were cured and discharged from the hospital. After a follow-up of six months, there was no recurrence of the lesions. Conclusions: Medical institutions must strictly follow infection control guidelines and take preventive measures to prevent such incidents from happening again. ALA -PDT as a combination therapy for nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) skin infections can improve treatment efficacy and shorten antibiotic usage time. (Clin. Lab. 2024;70:1192-1195.

This study used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins in sera from BC and healthy volunteers (HV), with the goal of developing a new prognostic biomarker panel. Methods: Training set serum samples from 99 BC and 51 HV subjects were applied to four adsorptive chip surfaces (anion-exchange, cation-exchange, hydrophobic, and metal affinity) and analyzed by time-of-flight MS. For validation, 100 independent BC serum samples and 70 HV samples were analyzed similarly. Cluster analysis of protein spectra was performed to identify protein patterns related to BC and HV groups. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to develop a protein panel to distinguish breast cancer sera from healthy sera, and its prognostic potential was evaluated. Results: From 51 protein peaks that were significantly up- or downregulated in BC patients by univariate analysis, binary logistic regression yielded five protein peaks that together classified BC and HV with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area-under-the-curve value of 0.961. Validation on an independent patient cohort confirmed the five-protein parameter (ROC value 0.939). The five-protein parameter showed positive association with large tumor size (P = 0.018) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.016). By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, immunoprecipitation and western blotting the proteins were identified as a fragment of apolipoprotein H (ApoH), ApoCl, complement C3a, transthyretin, and ApoAI. Kaplan-Meier analysis on 181 subjects after median follow-up of >5 years demonstrated that the panel significantly predicted disease-free survival (P = 0.005), its efficacy apparently greater in women with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (n = 50, P = 0.003) compared to ER-positive (n = 131, P = 0.161), although the influence of ER status needs to be confirmed after longer follow-up. Conclusions: Protein mass profiling by MS has revealed five serum proteins which, in combination, can distinguish between serum from women with breast cancer and healthy control subjects with high sensitivity and specificity. The five-protein panel significantly predicts recurrence-free survival in women with ER-negative tumors and may have value in the management of these patients.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,

Methods The case-control study was included 150 controls and 66 cases with PCV. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein B (APOB) together with systemic risk factors including gender, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and asthma were identified. All subjects were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from three genes in the HDL metabolic pathway: rs10468017 of hepatic lipase (LIPC), rs12678919 of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), rs3764261 and rs173539 of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Students t-tests, chi-square tests, anova and logistic regression were used to evaluate associations. Results Hyperlipidemia was a risk factor (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, P = 0.001) for PCV. HDL, LDL and APOB levels were associated with PCV (OR = 0.001, P = 0.004; OR = 0.099, P = 0.010; OR = 0.839, P = 0.018). Higher level of TC was potently associated with increased risk of PCV (OR = 109.8, P = 0.000). LIPC rs10468017 was a risk factor for PCV (OR = 11.68, P = 0.000). CETP rs3764261 conferred a decreased risk for PCV (OR = 0.08, P = 0.000). No associations of LPL rs12678919 or CETP rs173539 with PCV were found. Mean level of HDL increased with T allele of the CETP gene (p = 0.026): 1.24 mmol/L (+/- 0.31) for the GG genotype and 1.66 mmol/L (+/- 0.54) for the TT genotype. Additionally, T allele was associated with the following increase in APOA1: 136.78 mg/dl (+/- 20.53) for the CC genotype and 149.57 mg/dl (+/- 22.67) for the TT genotype of LIPC and 137.91 mg/dl (+/- 20.36) for the GG genotype and 162.67 mg/dl (+/- 22.50) for the TT genotype of CETP gene. Conclusion Our study suggested that the significant association was found between hyperlipidemia, the serum levels of TC, HDL, LDL and APOB and PCV. The result of present study also showed that the association of LIPC rs10468017 and CETP rs3764261 with PCV.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,

Methods A multicenter study was conducted between October 2019 and September 2020 at four hospitals located in central (Tikur Anbessa and Yekatit 12), southern (Hawassa) and northern (Dessie) parts of Ethiopia. A total of 1416 patients clinically investigated for sepsis were enrolled. The number of patients from Tikur Anbessa, Yekatit 12, Dessie and Hawassa hospital was 501, 298, 301 and 316, respectively. At each study site, blood culture was performed from all patients and positive cultures were characterized by their colony characteristics, gram stain and conventional biochemical tests. Each bacterial species was confirmed using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI TOF). Antimicrobial resistance pattern of bacteria was determined by disc diffusion. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations of dependent and independent variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Among 1416 blood cultures performed, 40.6% yielded growth. Among these, 27.2%, 0.3% and 13.1%, were positive for pathogenic bacteria, yeast cells and possible contaminants respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.1%), Klebsiella variicola (18.1%) and E. coli (12.4%) were the most frequent. Most K. variicola were detected at Dessie (61%) and Hawassa (36.4%). Almost all Pantoea dispersa (95.2%) were isolated at Dessie. Rare isolates (0.5% or 0.2% each) included Leclercia adecarboxylata, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia cepacia, Kosakonia cowanii and Lelliottia amnigena. Enterobacteriaceae most often showed resistance to ampicillin (96.2%), ceftriaxone (78.3%), cefotaxime (78%), cefuroxime (78%) and ceftazidime (76.4%). MDR frequency of Enterobacteriaceae at Hawassa, Tikur Anbessa, Yekatit 12 and Dessie hospital was 95.1%, 93.2%, 87.3% and 67.7%, respectively. Carbapenem resistance was detected in 17.1% of K. pneumoniae (n = 111), 27.7% of E. cloacae (n = 22) and 58.8% of Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 34). Conclusion Diverse and emerging gram-negative bacterial etiologies of sepsis were identified. High multidrug resistance frequency was detected. Both on sepsis etiology types and MDR frequencies, substantial variation between hospitals was determined. Strategies to control MDR should be adapted to specific hospitals. Standard bacteriological services capable of monitoring emerging drug-resistant sepsis etiologies are essential for effective antimicrobial stewardship.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,"Sepsis etiologies; Emerging pathogens; Multidrug resistance; Multicenter

Studies of candidate genes may provide a novel insight and treatment strategy for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between KOA susceptibility and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ADAMTS-5 gene.Materials and methodsThe case group included 188 patients from Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital with clinically and radiographically diagnosed primary KOA, and the control group included 100 age-matched individuals without KOA. Fifteen ADAMTS-5 SNPs were assayed using MALDI-TOF MS. Allelic and haplotypic frequencies were compared between the groups. The relationship between genotype distribution and risk of KOA was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.ResultsThe frequency of A allele in rs2249350 site in the KOA group was significantly lower (odds ratio [OR]: 0.761; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.612-0.947; P = 0.016), while that of C allele was higher than that in the control group (OR: 1.176; 95% CI: 1.025-1.351; P = 0.016). AA genotype and gene model, especially recessive gene model at rs2249350 locus, negatively correlated with KOA risk after adjustment for sex, body mass index, age, and occupation (AA vs. CC: OR: 0.288; 95% CI: 0.124-0.669; P = 0.004; AA vs. CA + CC: OR: 0.348; 95% CI: 0.162-0.749; P = 0.007). Meanwhile, one protective haplotype, GA (rs229054, rs2249350) (OR: 0.763; 95% CI: 0.614-0.949; P = 0.017), and one high-risk haplotype, GC (rs229054, rs2249350) (OR: 1.259; 95% CI: 1.032-1.537; P = 0.019), were found in this study.ConclusionDespite a limited sample size, our study suggests that the rs2249350 polymorphism in the ADAMTS-5 gene is one of the genetic factors influencing the risk of KOA. The A allele and AA genotype of rs2249350 may protect from KOA, whereas C allele and CC genotype increase the risk of KOA. In addition, the GA haplotype (rs229054, rs2249350) might be associated with a decreased risk of KOA, whereas the GC haplotype (rs229054, rs2249350) may be a risk factor for KOA. Additional larger-sized studies in more ethnically diverse populations are needed to confirm these findings.",English,gold,Article,"ADAMTS-5; Gene; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Association; Aggrecan;

10.1371/journal.pone.0018682,PLOS ONE,2011,New Insights into the Lake Chad Basin Population Structure Revealed by High-Throughput Genotyping of Mitochondrial DNA Coding SNPs,"Cerezo, M","Background: Located in the Sudan belt, the Chad Basin forms a remarkable ecosystem, where several unique agricultural and pastoral techniques have been developed. Both from an archaeological and a genetic point of view, this region has been interpreted to be the center of a bidirectional corridor connecting West and East Africa, as well as a meeting point for populations coming from North Africa through the Saharan desert. Methodology/Principal Findings: Samples from twelve ethnic groups from the Chad Basin (n = 542) have been high-throughput genotyped for 230 coding region mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (mtSNPs) using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. This set of mtSNPs allowed for much better phylogenetic resolution than previous studies of this geographic region, enabling new insights into its population history. Notable haplogroup (hg) heterogeneity has been observed in the Chad Basin mirroring the different demographic histories of these ethnic groups. As estimated using a Bayesian framework, nomadic populations showed negative growth which was not always correlated to their estimated effective population sizes. Nomads also showed lower diversity values than sedentary groups. Conclusions/Significance: Compared to sedentary population, nomads showed signals of stronger genetic drift occurring in their ancestral populations. These populations, however, retained more haplotype diversity in their hypervariable segments I (HVS-I), but not their mtSNPs, suggesting a more ancestral ethnogenesis. Whereas the nomadic population showed a higher Mediterranean influence signaled mainly by sub-lineages of M1, R0, U6, and U5, the other populations showed a more consistent sub-Saharan pattern. Although lifestyle may have an influence on diversity patterns and hg composition, analysis of molecular variance has not identified these differences. The present study indicates that analysis of mtSNPs at high resolution could be a fast and extensive approach for screening variation in population studies where labor-intensive techniques such as entire genome sequencing remain unfeasible.",English,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",Article,

The sand fly fauna on the Balkan Peninsula, including Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH), is diverse and the circulation of Leishmania infantum as well as phleboviruses has been proven. However, recent data on the sand fly fauna in BIH are scarce. In this study, we surveyed understudied regions in central and northeastern BIH to update the sand fly distribution and gain insights into the ecological and environmental factors shaping their appearance. CDC light trapping was conducted in 2022 and 2023 and a combination of morphological and molecular methods (cytochrome oxidase I barcoding) was performed for species identifications. We mapped the currently known distribution, modelled climatic suitability patterns and performed environmental analyses by applying machine learning methods. In addition, we analyzed blood meals by host gene sequencing and MALDI-TOF peptide mass mapping and screened for Leishmania spp. DNA and Phlebovirus RNA. Altogether, 591 sand flies of four species were trapped, predominantly Phlebotomus neglectus (97 %), but also Ph. balcanicus, Ph. mascittii, and Ph. papatasi. Records of seven sand fly species known to be endemic were plotted onto distribution maps based on 101 datapoints, identifying Ph. neglectus as the overall predominant species. The environmental analyses of sand fly species indicated variation in altitudinal, thermal, and precipitation conditions across the sand fly-positive sites. Phlebotomus simici, Phlebotomus tobbi, and Sergentomyia minuta are typically found exclusively in Mediterranean and subtropical climate zones, whereas other species typically inhabit continental regions. The Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation of sand fly species numbers and Shannon entropy values suggested the southeastern coastal region of BIH as a primary focus for sand fly occurrence. This finding was corroborated by modeled average climatic suitability patterns for sand flies, depicting four distinct meso-regions for sand fly occurrence. The results of the ensemble method highlight the importance of annual precipitation to distinguish between positive and negative sand fly trapping sites in BIH. In total, 55 blood meals of two sand fly species, Ph. neglectus and Ph. balcanicus, , were analyzed and five host species identified. Our comprehensive assessment of ecological and environmental preferences of sand flies in BIH may support further entomological surveys and help to better understand and evaluate potential hot spots of disease transmission in the country.",English,hybrid,Article,Barcoding; Blood meal; MALDI; Environmental analyses; Balkan

We evaluated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the apolipoprotein APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster and the MetS risk and analyzed the interactions of environmental factors and APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster polymorphisms with MetS. Methods A study on the prevalence and risk factors for MetS was conducted using data from a large cross-sectional survey representative of the population of Jilin Province situated in northeastern China. A total of 16,831 participations were randomly chosen by multistage stratified cluster sampling of residents aged from 18 to 79 years in all nine administrative areas of the province. Environmental factors associated with MetS were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses based on the weighted sample data. A subsample of 1813 survey subjects who met the criteria for MetS patients and 2037 controls from this case-control study were used to evaluate the association between SNPs and MetS risk. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes, and SNP genotyping was determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The associations between SNPs and MetS were examined using a case-control study design. The interactions of environmental factors and APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster polymorphisms with MetS were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results The overall adjusted prevalence of MetS was 32.86% in Jilin province. The prevalence of MetS in men was 36.64%, which was significantly higher than the prevalence in women (29.66%). MetS was more common in urban areas (33.86%) than in rural areas (31.80%). The prevalence of MetS significantly increased with age (OR = 8.621, 95% CI = 6.594-11.272). Mental labor (OR = 1.098, 95% CI = 1.008-1.195), current smoking (OR = 1.259, 95% CI = 1.108-1.429), excess salt intake (OR = 1.252, 95% CI = 1.149-1.363), and a fruit and dairy intake less than 2 servings a week were positively associated with MetS (P<0.05). A family history of diabetes (OR = 1.630, 95% CI = 1.484-1.791), cardiovascular disease or cerebral diseases (OR = 1.297, 95% CI = 1.211-1.389) was associated with MetS. APOA1 rs670, APOA5 rs662799 and rs651821 revealed significant differences in genotype distributions between the MetS patients and control subjects. The minor alleles of APOA1 rs670, APOA5 rs662799 and rs651821, and APOA5 rs2075291 were associated with MetS (P<0.0016). APOA1 rs5072 and APOC3 rs5128, APOA5 rs651821 and rs662799 were in strong linkage disequilibrium to each other with r(2) greater than 0.8. Five haplotypes were associated with an increased risk of MetS (OR = 1.23, 1.58, 1.80, 1.90, and 1.98). When we investigated the interactions of environmental factors and APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster gene polymorphisms, we found that APOA5 rs662799 had interactions with tobacco use and alcohol consumption (P-GE<0.05). Conclusions There was a high prevalence of MetS in the northeast of China. Male gender, increasing age, mental labor, family history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cerebral diseases, current smoking, excess salt intake, fruit and dairy intake less than 2 servings a week, and drinking were associated with MetS.

Clinical mastitis in Denmark is most often treated with a combination of local and systemic treatment with penicillin. The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to assess whether worse results could be expected with local intramammary treatment with penicillin compared with a combination of local and systemic treatment with penicillin in terms of the bacteriological cure of mild and moderate clinical mastitis cases caused by gram-positive bacteria. We carried out a noninferiority trial with a noninferiority margin set to a relative reduction in bacteriological cure of 15% between these 2 treatment groups to assess the effect of reducing the total antibiotic use by a factor of 16 for each treated case. Clinical mastitis cases from 12 Danish dairy farms were considered for enrollment. On farm selection of gram-positive cases was carried out by the farm personnel within the first 24 h after a clinical mastitis case was detected. A single farm used bacterial culture results from the on-farm veterinarian, whereas the other 11 farms were provided with an on-farm test to distinguish gram-positive bacteria from gram-negative or samples without bacterial growth. Cases with suspected gram-positive bacteria were allocated to a treatment group: either local or combination. Bacteriological cure was assessed based on the bacterial species identified in the milk sample from the clinical mastitis case and 2 follow-up samples collected approximately 2 and 3 wk after ended treatment. Identification of bacteria was carried out using MALDI-TOF on bacterial culture growth. Noninferiority was assessed using unadjusted cure rates and adjusted cure rates from a multivariable mixed logistic regression model. Of the 1,972 clinical mastitis cases registered, 345 (18%) met all criteria for inclusion (full data). The data set was further reduced to 265 cases for the multivariable analysis to include only complete registrations. Streptococcus uberis was the most commonly isolated pathogen. Noninferiority was demonstrated for both unadjusted and adjusted cure rates. The unadjusted cure rates were 76.8% and 83.1% for the local and combined treatments, respectively (full data). The pathogen and somatic cell count before the clinical case had an effect on the efficacy of treatment; thus efficient treatment protocols should be herd-and case-specific. The effect of pathogen and somatic cell count on treatment efficacy was similar irrespective of the treatment protocol. We conclude that bacteriological cure of local penicillin treatment for mild and moderate clinical mastitis cases was non inferior to the combination of local and systemic treatment using a 15% noninferiority margin. This suggests that a potential 16-fold reduction in antimicrobial use per mastitis treatment can be achieved with no adverse effect on cure rate.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"intramammary treatment; intramuscular; Key intramammary treatment;

Together with candidate gene association studies (CGAS), multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be associated with LA in European populations. To date, no replication studies have been reported in independent Chinese samples. Methods: Here, we performed a candidate gene association study comprising 220 Chinese subjects with LA and 50 controls. Thirty-nine polymorphisms on 32 risk genes were selected from previous studies, and they were genotyped through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Genetic association analysis was firstly performed in all subjects with LA. Then, the same analysis was conducted in the six random sampling cohorts of 50 LA patients, respectively. Data analyses on the associations of SNPs with LA risk were evaluated through Pearson's chi(2) and multivariate logistic regression tests. Results: We found that eight polymorphisms in six genes (PMF1, ICAM1, TRIM65, AGT, FBF1, and ACOX1) were significantly associated with LA in the genetic association tests. Except for those eight gene variants, 24 other polymorphisms were not found to be significantly associated with LA in general genetic model, dominant model, recessive model, or multiplicative model. Among those eight polymorphisms, rs2984613 in PMF1 showed significant association with LA in the cohort of 220 LA subjects, and such significant association remained in both general genetic model (OR: 0.262, 95% CI: 0.091-0.752, p(adj) = 0.030) and recessive model (OR: 0.323, 95% CI: 0.119-0.881, p(adj) = 0.038) when controlling for clinical variables. Seven other significant variants (rs5498 in ICAM1, rs699 in AGT, rs2305913 in FBF1, rs1135640 in ACOX1, and rs3760128, rs7214628, and rs7222757 in TR1M65) were identified in those six random sampling tests that were conducted in the adjusted cohorts of 50 LA patients. In addition, except for rs699 which showed detrimental effect and represented a risk variant for LA, seven other polymorphisms seemed to exert protective effects on LA and to reduce the risk of LA. It is necessary to confirm these associations in an independent cohort. Conclusions: This first replication study on multiple genes in an independent Chinese population did not replicate any risk polymorphisms for LA other than rs 699 in AGT but revealed the significantly negative associations of PMF1 , ICAM1, TRIM65, FBF1, and ACOX1 polymorphisms with LA. It not only supported the strong ethnic differences in the genetics of LA but also indicated that those six identified genes may be involved in Chinese white matter lesions.

The purpose of this study is to identify the molecular characterization and risk factors of CREC in Fujian province, China. Methods A total of 48 CREC isolates were collected from various clinical samples. The strains were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the standard broth microdilution method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen common drug resistance genes. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to type isolates. RT-qPCR was used to detect gene expression of acrA, acrB, and tolC. Conjugation assays were used to analyze the transferability of plasmids carrying mcr-1 or blaNDM. Risk factors for CREC infection were identified by logistic regression analysis. Results 48 CREC strains were collected, with 81.25% producing carbapenemase (CP-CREC), and 18.75% were not producing carbapenemase (no-CP-CREC). They belonged to 21 sequence type (STs) and five unknown STs. Perianal swabs were the main sample type, with 25 patients found to have hematological malignancies. All isolates of CP-CREC were found to contain blaNDM (blaNDM-5 (n = 32), blaNDM-1 (n = 5), blaNDM-4 (n = 1), and blaNDM-13 (n = 1)), among which one isolate co-existence blaNDM-5 and blaOXA-48. Two blaNDM-positive strains, specifically blaNDM-5 and blaNDM-4, were found to co-habor mcr-1 with ST617. Conjugation assays confirmed that blaNDM-1, blaNDM-13, and most blaNDM-5(68.75%, 22/32) could be transferred between E. coli strains. Four of the 9 non-CP-CREC isolates had deletions in ompC and ompF with blaCTX-M production, while the other five showed high expression of acrA, acrB, and tolC. Antibiotics usage, antifungal treatment, detection of other pathogens (prior to CREC infection), and respiratory disease were identified as independent risk factors for CREC infection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the scoring system was 0.937. Youden's index, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 and 0.78, was maximal when 2 points were scored. Conclusions In CP-CREC, carbapenem resistance is caused primarily by multiple types of blaNDM, while non-CP-CREC is caused by loss of porin protein or high expression of efflux pumps coupled with carrying blaCTX-M. CREC isolates were highly diverse in terms of ST, with a total of 21 STs identified. Here, we first describe a clinical strain of CREC from China both mcr-1 and blaNDM -4 with ST617.

Rare isolates (0.8% each) included Raoultella ornithinolytica, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Alcalignes faecalis, Pantoea ecurina, Bacillus flexus, and Paenibacillus tylopili. Enterobacteriaceae showed high levels of resistance to most of the tested antibiotics but lower levels of ertapenem (32.9%), amikacin (24.3%), imipenem (20.3%), and meropenem (17.6%) resistance. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) frequency of Enterobacteriaceae at Debre Tabor, Hawassa, Jimma, and Tikur Anbessa hospitals was 84.5%, 96.5%, 97.3%, and 94%, respectively. Ages >= 61 years (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.02-7.99; P 0.046), prolonged duration of hospital stay (AOR = 4.15, 95% CI: 2.87-6.01; P 0.000), history of previous antibiotics use (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.06-2.80; P 0.028), history of smoking (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.44-3.83; P 0.001), emergency surgery (AOR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.92-3.66; P 0.000), and duration of operation (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.181-0.392; P 0.000) were significant risk factors.Conclusion The most prevalent isolates from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria across all hospitals were S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. Many newly emerging Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were identified. Variation between hospitals was found for both SSI etiology type and MDR frequencies. Hence, to prevent the emergence and spread of MDR bacteria, standard bacteriological tests and their AST are indispensable for effective antimicrobial stewardship.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,"Surgical site infections etiologies; Emerging pathogens; Multidrug

However, there is limited data on the antibiotic prescription appropriateness and resistance information in the Malaysian private primary care setting, therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of isolated viruses and bacteria, antibiotic resistance patterns, antibiotic prescription patterns and appropriateness by general practitioners (GPs) and factors affecting antibiotic resistance and antibiotic prescription patterns. To investigate, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 205 patients presenting with AP symptoms at private primary care clinics in central Malaysia from 3(rd) January 2016 to 30(th) November 2016. Throat swabs were collected from 205 AP patients for two purposes: (i) the detection of four common respiratory viruses associated with AP via reverse-transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); and (ii) bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Bacterial isolates were then subjected to antibiotic susceptibility screening and McIsaac scoring was calculated post-prescription based on GP selection of criteria. Generalized estimating equations analysis with multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with presence of virus and antibiotic prescription. The results showed that 95.1% (195/205) of patients had at least one of the four viruses, with rhinovirus (88.5%) being the most prevalent, followed by adenovirus (74.9%), influenza A virus (4.6%) and enterovirus (2.1%). A total of 862 non-repetitive colonies were isolated from the culture of throat swabs from 205 patients who were positive for bacteria. From a total of 22 genera, Streptococcus constitutes the most prevalent bacteria genus (40.9%), followed by Neisseria (20%), Rothia (13.0%), Staphylococcus (11%) and Klebsiella (4.9%). Only 5 patients carried group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). We also report the presence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus or VRSA (n = 9, 10.1%) among which one isolate is a multidrug-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MDR-MRSA), while 54.1% (n = 111) were found to carry at least one antibiotic-resistant bacteria species. Application of the McIsaac scoring system indicated that 87.8% (n = 180) of patients should not be prescribed antibiotics as the majority of AP patients in this study had viral pharyngitis. The antibiotic prescription appropriateness by applying post-prescription McIsaac scoring was able to rule out GABHS pharyngitis in this sample with a GABHS culture-positive sensitivity of 40% (n = 2/5) and specificity of 90% (180/200). In conclusion, antibiotic-resistant throat isolates and over-prescription of antibiotics were observed and McIsaac scoring system is effective in guiding GPs to determine occurrences of viral pharyngitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription.",English,"Green Published, gold",Article,
10.1007/s40262-013-0057-6,CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,2013,Simultaneous Pharmacogenetics-Based Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Darunavir and Ritonavir in HIV-Infected Patients,"Moltó, J","Darunavir is a potent protease inhibitor of HIV. To enhance its pharmacokinetic profile, darunavir must be co-administered with ritonavir. There is wide inter-patient variability in darunavir pharmacokinetics among HIV-infected individuals, however. Darunavir is a known substrate for influx transporters, such as the 1A2 and the 1B1 members of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family (SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1), as well as for efflux transporters such as the multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). The aim of this study was to develop a semi-mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model for darunavir and ritonavir administered in HIV-infected adults. The desired model would incorporate patient characteristics and pharmacogenetic data contributing to variability in drug concentrations and also take into account the interaction between the two compounds. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with 705 plasma samples from 75 Caucasian individuals receiving darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) for at least 4 weeks. At least one full pharmacokinetic profile was obtained for each participant, and darunavir and ritonavir concentrations in plasma were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Genotyping for 148 polymorphisms in genes coding for transporters or metabolizing enzymes was conducted by two methods: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction-based allelic discrimination. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed for darunavir and for ritonavir. The effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on the post hoc individual pharmacokinetic parameters was first explored using graphic methods and regression analysis. Those covariates related to changes in darunavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were then further evaluated using non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM version VII). Darunavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were best described by a two- and one-compartment model, respectively, both with first-order absorption and elimination. The darunavir peripheral volume of distribution decreased as alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations increased. Darunavir clearance was 12 % lower in patients with SLCO3A1 rs8027174 GT/TT genotypes, while homozygosity for the rs4294800 A allele was associated with 2.5-fold higher central volume of distribution. Body weight influenced ritonavir clearance. Ritonavir inhibited darunavir clearance following a maximum-effect model. A population pharmacokinetic model to simultaneously describe the pharmacokinetics of darunavir and ritonavir was developed in HIV-infected patients. The model provides better understanding of the interaction between darunavir and ritonavir and suggests an association between SLCO3A1 polymorphisms and darunavir pharmacokinetics. Bayesian estimates of individual darunavir parameters and ritonavir may be useful to predict darunavir exposure.",English,,Article,

Dysregulation of the epigenetic machinery is a significant contributor to disease development. Some AML patients benefit from treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), but no predictive biomarkers for therapy response exist. Here, we investigated whether unbiased genome-wide assessment of pre-treatment DNA-methylation profiles in AML bone marrow blasts can help to identify patients who will achieve a remission after an azacytidine-containing induction regimen.ResultsA total of n = 155 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated in the AMLSG 12-09 trial were randomly assigned to a screening and a refinement and validation cohort. The cohorts were divided according to azacytidine-containing induction regimens and response status. Methylation status was assessed for 664,227 500-bp-regions using methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation-seq, resulting in 1755 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Top regions were distilled and included genes such as WNT10A and GATA3. 80% of regions identified as a hit were represented on HumanMethlyation 450k Bead Chips. Quantitative methylation analysis confirmed 90% of these regions (36 of 40 DMRs). A classifier was trained using penalized logistic regression and fivefold cross validation containing 17 CpGs. Validation based on mass spectra generated by MALDI-TOF failed (AUC 0.59). However, discriminative ability was maintained by adding neighboring CpGs. A recomposed classifier with 12 CpGs resulted in an AUC of 0.77. When evaluated in the non-azacytidine containing group, the AUC was 0.76.ConclusionsOur analysis evaluated the value of a whole genome methyl-CpG screening assay for the identification of informative methylation changes. We also compared the informative content and discriminatory power of regions and single CpGs for predicting response to therapy. The relevance of the identified DMRs is supported by their association with key regulatory processes of oncogenic transformation and support the idea of relevant DMRs being enriched at distinct loci rather than evenly distribution across the genome.Predictive response to therapy could be established but lacked specificity for treatment with azacytidine. Our results suggest that a predictive epigenotype carries its methylation information at a complex, genome-wide level, that is confined to regions, rather than to single CpGs. With increasing application of combinatorial regimens, response prediction may become even more complicated.ConclusionsOur analysis evaluated the value of a whole genome methyl-CpG screening assay for the identification of informative methylation changes.

This study was aimed at assessing the distribution of bovine mastitis and the isolation rate of S. aureus in milked cows of West Shewa Zone. The clinical mastitis was diagnosed by physical methods including observation and palpation, whereas the subclinical mastitis was tested by the California mastitis test (CMT). All of the cows tested for mastitis were aseptically sampled (teat-milk) for bacteriology. The bacterium was primarily identified based on colony characterization, catalase, coagulase tests, and Gram stain reaction. Finally, MALDI-TOF Biotyper confirmed the species. The antibacterial sensitivity characteristics of the isolates to different antibacterial drugs were tested by the disk diffusion method. The drugs were selected based on the frequent usage in veterinary medicine in the study area. By using particular primers, the presence of the resistance (mecA and blaZ), and thermonuclease (nuc) genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The data were analyzed by R statistical software. The associations between the dependent variables (prevalence of mastitis and S. aureus) and the explanatory variables were analysed by chi-square (?(2)) and logistic regression tests at a 95% confidence interval (CI). Accordingly, 258 lactating cows were examined, of which 97 (37.6%) were mastitis positive. Of these mastitis positive cows, 59 (60.8%) were subclinical and 38 (39.2%) were clinical. Among the 258 milk samples, 43 (16.7%) were positive for S. aureus. According to the results of the current investigation, subclinical mastitis was significantly more prevalent than clinical mastitis (p<0.05). The disease was found varied with the lactation stage of the animal, milking with washed hand, udder washing before milking, and tick infestation of the teat. In comparison to animals from farms with lower number of lactating cows, the prevalence of the bacteria was significantly higher in animals managed in farms with large (OR = 12.58, 95% CI = 2.33-68.54, and p<0.05) and medium (OR = 12.58, 95% CI = 2.33-68.54, and p<0.05) population of lactating cows per herd. The isoation rate of the bacterium was also found significantly higher in tick-infested cows (OR = 27.69, 95% CI = 9.71-93.01, and p<0.05) than tick free cows. The antibiogram tests revealed that the isolates resisted penicillin G and tetracycline group drugs (oxytetracycline and tetracycline). Moreover, the nuc gene was confirmed to be present in all of the examined isolates. However, they were not found harboring blaZ and mecA genes. We concluded that S. aureus is sustaining as a main causative agent of bovine mastitis, and they were resistant to the frequently used antibiotics in public and veterinary medicines in the study areas. Therefore, research-based interventions need to be taken in action to combat the pathogen.",English,"gold, Green Published",Article,

The predictive function of antifungal susceptibility and its correlation with treatment outcome remains controversial. A retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2016, on 85 patients with C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Antifungal drug susceptibility was determined using the YeastONE (TM) colorimetric broth microdilution method coupled with Vizion (TM) System following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Six antifungal agents-amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole-were tested. The patients' demographic data and clinical information were abstracted for further analyses. Antifungal regimens consisting of amphotericin B with or without fluconazole or flucytosine were administered for induction treatment of these patients, followed with intravenous or oral fluconazole for maintenance therapy. Clinical outcomes were defined by 14- and 30-day mortality rates. Risk factors associated with outcomes were fitted in a logistic regression model by univariate or multivariate method. Eighty-five patients with C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia were enrolled in the study. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, Charlson comorbidity score, and adequate duration of therapy for amphotericin B were predictors for mortality in univariate analysis. Antifungal susceptibility testing with YeastONE (TM) does not predict clinical outcomes of C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia. Greater disease severity, high comorbidities, poor consciousness level, and inappropriate treatment were associated with increased mortality in cryptococcemia cases. Lay Summary Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast living in both plants and animals that is composed of three main serotypes: C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. gattii, and C. neoformans var. neoformans. C. neoformans var. grubii is the most common disease-causing Cryptococcus species worldwide. C. neoformans var. gattii is more prevalent than C. neoformans var. neoformans in both tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. C. neoformans causes severe, even fatal, diseases such as pulmonary infection, bloodstream infection, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infection, central nervous system infection, and disseminated infection, regardless of host immunocompetence. We conducted a retrospective study on 85 patients who contracted cryptococcemia from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2016. This work conducted both microbiological and clinical studies involving in vitro susceptibility testing, demographic data, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and treatment outcomes. We utilized a modern medical technique-based instrument, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS; Biotyper, Bruker Daltonics, Inc.), which determines the unique proteomic fingerprint of an organism, to identify the C. neoformans serotype. We utilized Thermo Fisher Scientific (TM) Sensititre (TM) YeastONE (TM) colorimetric broth microdilution plates coupled with a Vizion (TM) Digital MIC Viewing System (a computer-assisted optical reading machine) to determine the in vitro susceptibility of amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole against 85 C. neoformans var. grubii blood isolates. In conclusion, the susceptibility patterns of these antifungal agents did not correlate significantly with treatment outcomes. However, a lower disease severity score, a lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, fewer comorbidities, and adequate amphotericin B treatment duration were predictors for treatment success in univariate analysis.",English,,Article,"Antifungal susceptibility; Cryptococcus neoformans var; grubii; YeastONE

10.1007/s12035-014-8930-3,MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY,2015,Proteomic and Mitochondrial Genomic Analyses of Pediatric Brain Tumors,"Luna, B","The molecular mechanism unraveling why a particular type of pediatric brain tumor (pBT) behaves so differently from child to child or genetic/epigenetic changes in the mitochondrial genome vary from tumor to tumor is not clearly understood. Despite the identification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in different types of pBT, the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes or proteins that are selectively up- or down-regulated in pBT of different types has not been comprehensively examined. In the present study, we combined a 2D DIGE approach with protein identification using MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/MS, coupled with mtDNA genomics to screen brain samples for discovering changes in protein expression, and mtDNA sequence variation and mtDNA copy number in the disease states. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based differential proteomic analysis of the brain tumors showed that 116 proteins were found to be up- or down-regulated in brain tumors. Some of the proteins up-regulated in tumors compared to controls were dihydropyrimidinase-like 2; glial fibrillary acidic protein isoform 2; phosphoserine aminotransferase isoform 1; Sirt2 histone deacetylase; and C10orf2 protein, mitochondrial DNA helicase. Proteins down-regulated in brain tumors compared to controls were heat shock protein 90 kDa beta, BiP; guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), beta polypeptide 2-like 1, isoform CRA_d; histone H2B.1; neurofilament, light polypeptide 68 kDa; Annexin I; and RAN. These differentially expressed proteins may provide useful information for developing molecular markers of diagnostic or prognostic value. To investigate further the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the effects of mtDNA copy number, oxidative damage, and mtDNA variants as independent or combined risk factors for the development of pBTs. Bayesian network and mechanistic hierarchical structure Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling were used to analyze the relationship between these variables. The combined effects of G3196, 9952A, 10006G, 100398G, oxidative mtDNA damages, and mtDNA copy number increased the probability of developing brain tumors in female children by 51 times more when compared to normal incidence of pediatric brain tumors. Comparison of mechanistic structure models also supported the finding that female children who have the wild type allele G3196, variant allele 9952A, variant allele 10006G, variant allele10398A, and high mtDNA copy number had increased probability of developing pediatric brain tumors. Estimation of nuclear genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and development of brain, cortical dysplasia, and the effect of the environment using MCMC method showed that these latent variables had a very significant contribution in the development of pediatric brain tumors. Together, these results suggest that mitochondrial genome and tumor proteome are important contributors to brain tumor risk in children, and findings from this study may guide the prospects for targeting mitochondria for therapeutic treatment of childhood brain tumor.",English,,Article,"Childhood brain tumors; Mitochondrial genome; Tumor proteome;

10.3791/3445,JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,2012,MALDI Imaging Mass Spectrometry of Neuropeptides in Parkinson's Disease,"Hanrieder, J","MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful approach that facilitates the spatial analysis of molecular species in biological tissue samples(2) (Fig. 1). A 12 mu m thin tissue section is covered with a MALDI matrix, which facilitates desorption and ionization of intact peptides and proteins that can be detected with a mass analyzer, typically using a MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. Generally hundreds of peaks can be assessed in a single rat brain tissue section. In contrast to commonly used imaging techniques, this approach does not require prior knowledge of the molecules of interest and allows for unsupervised and comprehensive analysis of multiple molecular species while maintaining high molecular specificity and sensitivity(2). Here we describe a MALDI IMS based approach for elucidating region-specific distribution profiles of neuropeptides in the rat brain of an animal model Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a common neurodegenerative disease with a prevalence of 1% for people over 65 of age(3,4). The most common symptomatic treatment is based on dopamine replacement using L-DOPA(5). However this is accompanied by severe side effects including involuntary abnormal movements, termed L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID)(1,3,6). One of the most prominent molecular change in LID is an upregulation of the opioid precursor prodynorphin mRNA(7). The dynorphin peptides modulate neurotransmission in brain areas that are essentially involved in movement control(7,8). However, to date the exact opioid peptides that originate from processing of the neuropeptide precursor have not been characterized. Therefore, we utilized MALDI IMS in an animal model of experimental Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA induced dyskinesia. MALDI imaging mass spectrometry proved to be particularly advantageous with respect to neuropeptide characterization, since commonly used antibody based approaches targets known peptide sequences and previously observed post-translational modifications. By contrast MALDI IMS can unravel novel peptide processing products and thus reveal new molecular mechanisms of neuropeptide modulation of neuronal transmission. While the absolute amount of neuropeptides cannot be determined by MALDI IMS, the relative abundance of peptide ions can be delineated from the mass spectra, giving insights about changing levels in health and disease. In the examples presented here, the peak intensities of dynorphin B, alpha-neoendorphin and substance P were found to be significantly increased in the dorsolateral, but not the dorsomedial, striatum of animals with severe dyskinesia involving facial, trunk and orolingual muscles (Fig. 5). Furthermore, MALDI IMS revealed a correlation between dyskinesia severity and levels of des-tyrosine alpha-neoendorphin, representing a previously unknown mechanism of functional inactivation of dynorphins in the striatum as the removal of N-terminal tyrosine reduces the dynorphin's opioid-receptor binding capacity(9). This is the first study on neuropeptide characterization in LID using MALDI IMS and the results highlight the potential of the technique for application in all fields of biomedical research.",English,"Bronze, Green Published, Green Submitted",Article,"Medicine; Issue 60; Parkinson's disease; L-DOPA induced dyskinesia;

The biggest problem in infections with K.pneumoniae is that treatment options are limited due to multiple antibiotic resistance and consequently the increased morbidity and mortality. The widespread and improper use of carbapenems can lead to epidemics that are difficult to control, especially in intensive care units because of the acquired resistance to this group of antibiotics. Outbreaks and sporadic cases caused by carbapenem resistant K.pneumoniae (CRKP) species have been reported all over the world in recent years with increased frequency. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors related to carbepenem resistance and mortality caused by K.pneumoniae infections in a university hospital anesthesia intensive care unit. The study was conducted between January 1st, 2016, and December 31st, 2018. Retrospective data were obtained from the patient and laboratory-based surveillance records. Adult patients (>= 18 years) with K.pneumoniae growth in the blood, urine, abscess and tracheal aspirate samples collected 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit were considered as the relevant infection locus-related agent and treated with antibacterial therapy. Clinical samples collected from patients were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood and eosin-methylene-blue (EMB) agar except the blood samples. Blood samples were cultured in blood culture bottles and incubated in an automated system. Gram staining was performed for the samples showing growth signal within five days and then inoculated onto 5% sheep blood and EMB agar media and were incubated for 18-24 hours at 35.5-37 degrees C. Identification of the isolates was performed using Bruker IVD MALDI Biotyper 2.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Almanya) based on ""matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)"". K.pneumoniae isolates were identified by obtaining reliability scores of 2.0 and above in the study. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed with Phoenix 100 (BD, New Jersey, ABD) automated system. Interpretations were made according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Combination disk diffusion test and polymerase chain reaction based tests were used to show the presence of carbapenemase in CRKP isolates. A total of 88 patients with K.pneumoniae infection were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 74 +/- 15 (range= 21-93) years and 60.2% were female. CRKP was detected in 32 patients (36.4%) and carbapenem-sensitive K.pneumoniae (CSKP) was detected in 56 patients. The presence of OXA-48 was found to be 68.8% in the carbapenem screening test performed by combination disc method in patients with CRKP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that previous use of colistin [Odds ratio (OR)= 19.108; 95% confidence interval (CI). 2.027-180.133; p= 0.010] and aminoglycoside (OR= 12.189; 95% CI= 1.256-118.334; p= 0.031) was an independent risk factor in terms of CRCP among the patients with K.pneumoniae infection. The 28-day mortality rates were 71.9% in the CRKP group (23/32) and 37.5% in the CSKP group (21/56). Presence of CRKP in terms of 28-day mortality (OR= 5.146; 95% CI= 1.839-14.398; p= 0.002) was an independent risk factor.

Its initial incorrect formulation as the unknown Au2Pd12 cluster, obtained from a well-refined low-temperature CCD X-ray diffraction analysis of its crystal structure, was primarily based upon its related molecular geometry to that of the previously reported [Au2Pd14(CO)(9)(PMe3)(11)](2+) (as the [PF6](-) salt) prepared from an analogous reaction of Pd-8(CO)(8)(PMe3)(7) and Au(PCy3)Cl in the presence of TlPF6. (Because X-ray scattering occurs via the electrons of atoms, an assignment in the crystal-structure determination of 1-Et of the two independent ""heavy"" atoms as either Tl (at. no. 81) or Au (at. no. 79) would result in non-distinguishable refinements). 1-Et was originally characterized by IR and P-31{H-1} NMR; attempted MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometric measurements were unsuccessful. The geometrically unprecedented pseudo-C-3h core of 1-Et may now be described as edge-fusions of three trigonal bipyramidal Pd-5 fragments to a central trigonal bipyramidal Tl2Pd3 kernel. Its formation was originally viewed as the condensation product of three partially ligated butterfly Pd-4(CO)(3)(PEt3)(3) fragments that are also linked to and stabilized by two capping naked Au+ cations. This proposed ""structure-to-synthesis"" approach led to the isolation of 1-Et in ca. 90% yield from the reaction in DMF of the butterfly Pd-4(CO)(5)(PEt3)(4) with the phosphine-scavenger Au(SMe2)Cl together with TlPF6. Our later realization and resulting conclusive evidence that its metal-core stoichiometry is Tl2Pd12 instead of Au2Pd12 was a consequence of: (1) our bothersome inability based upon a presumed Au2Pd12 core-geometry to interpret its complex P-31{H-1} NMR spectrum despite P-31{H-1} COSY experiments clearly showing couplings between the seven major resonances that are consistent with intramolecular processes involving only one species; (2) our subsequent direct preparation of the same Tl2Pd12 cluster (90% yield) from the reaction in THF of Pd-4(CO)(5)( PEt3)(4) with TlPF6 (mol. ratio, 3/2), and the ensuing low-temperature CCD X-ray determination revealing a virtually identical solid-state structure (as expected) but with P-31{H-1} NMR measurements displaying an analogous complex spectrum that now can be interpreted; and (3) an elemental analysis (Tl, Au, Pd, P), which had been delayed because of the misleading confidence concerning our initially assigned stoichiometry, that ascertained its present formulation; noteworthy is that an elemental analysis of a sample of this compound would not disclose its true identity unless directly tested for Tl (and the absece of Au). Gradient-corrected DFT calculations performed on the PH3-model of the crystallographically known butterfly Pd-4(CO)(5)(PPh3)(4) and on its hypothetical Tl+, Au+, and [Au(PH3)](+) adducts (where the optimized geometries consisted of a trigonal bipyramidal MPd4 core with an equatorial M = Tl+, Au+, or [Au(PH3)](+)) revealed: (a) that the monocationic Tl+ charge is primarily localized on thallium in contrast to the monocationic Au+ charge being much more delocalized over the entire molecule with charge density having been withdrawn mainly from CO ligands (relative to that of the neutral Pd-4(CO)(5)(PH3)(4)); (b) that the interactions of Tl+, Au+, or [Au(PH3)](+) adducts with a stable butterfly Pd-4(CO)(5)(PH3)(4) model are energetically favorable processes, with Au+ bonding being stronger than Tl+ bonding to Pd-4(CO)(5)(PH3)(4); and (c) that the presence of an additional PH3 ligand on the Au+ significantly weakens the Au-Pd bonding interactions such that its bonding energy is comparable with that of the Tl-Pd interactions.",English,,Review,
